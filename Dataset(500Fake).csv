"The case was very nice for a week or two and then stretched so bad that my phones corners were constantly popping out of it. I had to pop the phone back into the case every time i took the phone out of my pocket. Also the more rubbery part of the case (the sides that stretched) yellowed a lot after just a couple of weeks of use. Could not return it to Amazon bc i didnt have the original box so I submitted a warranty claim on the Otterbox website. They asked for photos and said that my case might qualify for a replacement and i need to ship it back to them. They said that they couldn’t provide a shipping label but my shipping fee will be waived on their side. Liars. So i go and spend $30 on shipping it back, send them the receipt and they say they are not going to reimburse it now. Would not even give me a gift card for that amount. So i end up spending $80 on a bad quality product that i dont even have anymore. I ask them if they can at least send me a replacement in a different color so there is no yellowing problem to which they agree (they said they would make an “exception” for me). But then they ignore me for days. FedEx said that they received my package on Dec 9 but on Dec 19 Otterbox said that they dont have anything and they cannot track my package bc the tracking website didn’t work which of course it did. That was the last email I received from a human. On Dec 22 I received an automatically generated email that my package has been received (13 days after it actually arrived) and that was it. They have been ignoring my emails and not responding. $80 and a lot of my free time down the drain. I would not recommend doing business with them to anyone. I trusted their reputation and I should not have. This is the worst customer service experience i have ever had.",1
"This item looks good, the 2-in-1 separate filter line is useful, and installation was straightforward.Unfortunately after 18 months, the faucet started leaking from inside the metal housing. Even when the faucet was turned off, water would leak slowly from inside the housing, down the line, and dripped over a few days. It ended up ruining my cabinet and the drywall on the ceiling of the floor below.The manufacturer, Kraus, claims a ""lifetime limited warranty"", but within the warranty text, the faucet hardware is only covered from defects for 1 year and 5 years, with more limits. After 1 year, they will also charge you for shipping the defective item back to them.I understand that I should have read the warranty terms in more detail before purchasing the item. However, I didn't expect a kitchen faucet to fail within such a short time frame, given how expensive it was. I also take issue with companies that try extract shipping fees from their customers when their products are defective and under warranty.Since I wasn't interested in paying for shipping to have a defective item repaired, and no longer trusted the manufacturer, I asked about return options. The agent condescendingly answered, ""honey, we're the manufacturer, you'll have to call Amazon about that"" and abruptly ended the conversation.I understand that defective items will occur from time to time. However, I do expect that companies stand by their products and provide support for their customers when it happens. Unfortunately Kraus is not one of those companies and I had to go through Amazon to get help with this situation.I'm sure most people who have bought this product have a faucet that's working fine. However, in the off chance that you get a defective unit, just know that Kraus will not be helpful. You're better off buying from another company for the same price range.",1
The handles fell off the replacements,1
It’s not like the pictures. No metal thing to hang it on. Looks homemade.,1
"These candles were lovely until one totally died even after battery replacement. It won't work at all. These are way too expensive to only last 4 months. I turn them on about 3 times/week for an hour, not every day. Disappointing!",1
"Dollar stores have a better quality then this product, and 10 times cheaper.",1
Keyboard is cheap looks like a disco . Slow,1
POST beeps indicating corrupt bios. Returning.,1
"First boot, saw the windows logo, then BSOD. Couldn't get it to recover as it didn't have a recovery image installed. Couldn't boot safe mode, error stating couldn't install windows in safe mode. BSOD after BSOD after BSOD. Additionally, Amazon customer service was lacking in this experience.Returned for refund. Gotta love the new 30 days to refund on higher priced items like this. Maybe I can order one next month.",1
"ive had this pc for a good 3 and a half years already bout it to play games, but after realizing the hardware was 10+ years old i couldnt play nothing on it so i just used it for school work and ext. Out of the 3 and half years ive had it most of the time ive had it it was either not working at asurion getting fixed or on and not even being used cause itll crash every opportunity it gets. I really wished i refunded when i had the chance but i was to ignorant, after these 3 years ive seen plenty of videos on these pc scams and ext and you can get this exact same computer for a quarter of its price. dont get scammed just because it looks good and has LED lights this computer is literally useless. For 500$ you can find a computer wayy more advanced than this one and last way longer. im truly upset on this purchase its the worst of my life (i just got done paying it off)",1
"Several times it shut down with hardware erro4s and is not compatible with Windows 11. And I constantly have to unplug the keyboard and the mouse and plug them back in to get them to work. I have to do the same with my camera. The box looks great but what a crappy computer it is slower than DialUp they give you a little USB to plug into the computer to have Wi-Fi. It’s the same size as the USB square that comes out of your wireless mouse. What an awful experience from the very first week I bought this computer to the last right now. It is completely shut down I’m in the middle of a business everything I have is on this computer on the cloud to return which I don’t have access now , it’s just horrible . Look at the second picture behind my computer, you’ll notice that the only things that are plugged in are the monitors, keyboard and mouse. And if you look at the first picture, you’ll notice the errors card via storage device, such as an external USB drive, which we don’t have faulty hardware such as a hard drive or CD ROM, which apparently we do now just awful.",1
This computer was marketed as a new gaming computer and never worked at a level for gaming. After a year of trying to make it work we brought it to a professional and they said the components were 5-6 years old and we were better of buying a different computer vs trying to update/fix this one. Thanks for making a kids dream Christmas gift a complete lemon.,1
"This computer is garbage! Parts are from 2011. You'll spend more than what u bought it for to upgrade it to work for ur games! Do urself a favour, save ur money & DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER!",1
"I want a full refund of my money you can’t even use the internet without it lagging, can’t even load fortnite let alone play it got into one match with 4 fps with everything to the lowest I will not stop emailing until you have refunded me",1
"This PC was great to look at, and that's about it. The Wifi was terrible/damaged idk. We even used a third party wifi adapter and it was still awful. We have a 330mbs internet and all my other devices ran fast, so that wasn't the problem. Afterwards, it didn't detect my monitor. I ran it for a couple of minutes and nothing. It sounds like a jet engine while it's running as well. Over all, this PC is not worth the headache I went through. Save your money and look for another option.",1
"The monitor support bar didn't fit .. then once we rigged something together and set it up it kept restarting, wouldn't get past initial set up. DO BETTER !!!",1
The media could not be loaded. The pc and the monitor would not connect at all. The monitor would flash on and say no signal then turn off. The desktop itself from the moment of turning it on made that very loud motor boat sound. The advertised keyboard and mouse were not included a standard set was.I called support who advised they would try and connect me with a IT Person and that took over 30 mins. IT kept telling me to unplug it and plug it back in. Return support was not helpful either please don’t waste time or money on this!,1
Fine for the first few times that it was being used but now is laggy or completely shuts down. Only purchased in August of 2023 and it's now January 2024 so only had it for less than 5 months and it isn't even used heavily. Disappointing.,1
"product is very very bad packaged , LED not working with a very very very small electricity output cable . i literally had to get a power source 5CM beside it to make it fit and still LED not working",1
"This console was a brick the day it was released. As usual, Microsoft is years behind its competitors. I don’t even know why I was stupid enough to purchase one. The biggest issue is that in order to play games you purchased, you must constantly update them. That’s ridiculous. Why? It was working just fine. The other issue is that it continues to take up more and more space. I regret few things in life, but purchasing this junk has to be on the top. Save yourself some headache and buy a different system.",1
"I bought this ”refurbished” console in July, and it stopped turning on in November. This was sold as an “Amazon Refurbished” console. The customer support at Amazon told me they wouldn’t replace it, and they wouldn’t take a return on it. The “warranty is for 90 days,” and the console turned into a brick at 120 days, so there’s nothing that Amazon will do to stand behind their product. They told me to contact Microsoft for help. The warranty that Microsoft gives is from the original purchase date of the console. In my case the “Microsoft warranty” ended on Nov. 21st, and the console quit working on Nov. 25th. So lucky me the only thing I can do is pay Microsoft an additional $300 to get this console replaced. So because I’m one month outside of 90 days and 4 days past a warranty that started before I even owned the console I now own a $450 paper weight. And if I want the company to fix or replace it I get to own what will be a $750 console. All because I trusted Amazon to sell a working “refurbished” console.",1
I thought I’d give this a go seeing as it was Microsoft refurbished. Looked brand new when opened. Everything was great. Then while installing games and watching a movie it locked up. I rebooted and it would lock up then shut off. I reset it several times. Same issue. Safe to say the SSD failed. Spend the few extra dollars and buy new. Waste of time and money.,1
"Picked the referbished unit for the savings. Worth the price. Came with the full warranty. Controller looks new. Was the price of a used one on the local buy and sells, and has warranty. A no lose situation.Update, controller drift after 40 days. Amazon will not accept return and Microsoft will not warranty. DO NOT PURCHASE****",1
"I bought this as a gift and unfortunately was left extremely disappointed. The controller didn’t work, the console freezes during game play with almost every single game we tried and then one week later it will not turn on. Well, it turns on, but nothing will display on the TV other than the Xbox logo. Extremely disappointing and embarrassing given it was a gift. Seems that buying a new one may be worth the money if this is the best alternative. Returning asap and will be using the money toward a new console from a legitimate seller.",1
Product failed on second day. Returned!,1
"Package arrived early, which was nice, console turned on and worked fine, until it came to reading the discs. The console did not work any further than the home screen, super disappointing. And upon trying to clean the disc scanner, the console was customized so there is no access to this point of the hardware; a part allowing you to go further is missing and replaced with a custom piece that won’t move, meaning if it is broken, its broken. There’s no hope in repairing it yourself. Was looking forward to it but was let down",1
I understand this item was not going to be brand new. That said the quality is very poor. Rusted insides not refurbished at all. Does not power on. Oveall disappointed that they would even take someones money and be ok with sending this out.,1
"This phone was not usable on Straight Talk Wireless. Straight Talk informed me that the phone was locked and could not be used on their service until it was unlocked. This phone is listed as unlocked and usable on any service. I contacted Samsung because these are new phones, they had me do a factory reset on the phone and said that would fix the issue. This did nothing to fix the problem.",1
"UPDATE: After having this phone for months I have to say it's the biggest POS that I've ever had!! More glitches than I could list. I took 4 stars away because I'm so angry at all the glitches. Now I'm going to go back to my A10E, at least that was reliable!!I decided to wait to write a review because I was on the fence about keeping it or not. My previous phone was a Samsung A10E which is not a very heavy phone. The A15 is considerably heavier which I am (still) not very comfortable with. Comparing the 2 phones as far as memory is concerned is markedly different. The A10E has 32 gigs of internal memory. The A15 has 128 gigs of internal memory. Considering that I have alot of pics on my phone with several different albums, this makes the A15 a better product. The battery life is quite good. The appearance is beautiful. I purchased the light blue phone. I have a clear cover on my phone. This is my 4th Samsung cell phone. Samsung never disappoints with quality, durability and performance. I love the Samsung Smart Switch which makes moving your data from one phone to another fast and super easy. They don't provide a SIM card or micro SD card so you need to make sure to move your cards into your new phone. The software is similar to previous Samsung phone with a few tweaks. For example, to get a screen shot for the A15 you need to press both power and volume down button simultaneously. What makes the A15 different from any of my previous Samsungs is with the A15 you have to press each twice. There is a feature that would put a floating icon on your screen and open it and tap screenshot then you will get your screenshot. Now, what sold me on the A15 is a neat feature where, upon your approval, they will block all spam/scam phone calls. So no more annoying spam/scam calls!! It's a neat feature!! Like I said, I love Samsung phones!!",1
"How many apps do you think you have on your phone? 40? 50? how about your phone from 2 or 3 years ago? 15-20 tops? LOL ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are ""system apps"" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, ""just uninstall them and move on!"" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no ""delete"" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like ""com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000"" and ""<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . . E.V.E.R.Y. LOG - INNNN!at this point i am thinking about a jitterbug and some stress eating of sour worms to relax.but yeah the phones cool, other than that.",1
"This was my 2x trying Amazon Renewed. This time I purchased the LAST stated available 2023 described as ""In OEM box, Box shows wear from opening"". The Moto Razor Flip phone was described as ""Like new"". Immediately upon arrival w/o even opening the box I knew it was wrong as the package was far too light. I opened it & there was a Moto Razor w/obvious discoloration on the case from use + a CHIP in the bottom screen. Packaging was similar to a top end Samsung I ordered from Amazon Renewed & fulfilled by a 3rd Party in FL 2 years ago. I saved due to credit only $20 @ checkout over a NEW One. WORSE there's NO WAY to return this immediately (There' are 2 Amazon Return 2 locations within 2-5 minutes of my house. Just came back from one & CS stated ""I've never seen this"")). Instead Amazon MAY notify me when they'll ONLY pickup from my house in 3 days.I had this EXACT same problem with a $700+ Laptop that was supposed to be Brand New. I'm beyond a coder or tech guy & ran a battery cycle count software on that as the battery lasted 2 hours less than advertised. It was obviously a RETURN, re-sold as NEW, unless Compaq sells Laptops w/over 200 battery cycles already on them. Same thing w/2 PB's & a CH Android Tablet which still had the previous User's name & account information installed. Seriously, WHO is doing QC? I'll NEVER use Renewed again. Period. Even when you buy a NEW item it's 50/50 now you'll get someone else's return sold as New! eBay here I come again. Worst thing this was supposed to be a gift. OBVIOUS Screen CHIP really ticks me off. Since 2022 I'm now 2 for 8+ on purchases of tech devices. Buy with caution!",1
The system worked well for a few days .Then multiple issues launching any game arose.All games were bought new .Very aggravating.Not sure what to do now .I guess I just threw away money for a game console that barely works .Hope other people have better luck .Take care .,1
"Ever since I got this thing it’s been a source of frustration. It picks and chooses what games it allows me to play. Whenever I put a disk in it won’t read it, it’ll say open tray as of there isn’t even a dick inside. I have to open and close the tray 5+ times to get it to work. Sometimes it doesn’t. Some games it won’t play at all. I have a feeling that whoever inspected this thing before resale just looked it over and said “looks fine to me” and pushed it down the line. Piece of junk",1
"Not sure if I received a defective batch, but this set was horrible. All the “slimes” were sticky like glue and watery. Not useable. Waste of money.",1
"Well where do I begin? The tray door wasn't opening, handled that. It's not playing any of the games at all. This game system specifically said in good condition not seeing that at all. It's not even reading any of the games at all. So basically I just wasted $367 so I definitely feel like I have been scammed. This is so ridiculous. Ordered through Amazon I thought was a reliable place. Never had any problems before through them. So I figured why not? Well this is the absolute last time I'll be ordering anything that's refurbished or used. This is pure junk Xbox 360. Wasted my money and time. So thank you for that.....I hope this helps the next buyer plz beware of the scams.",1

"The media could not be loaded. Ok, I’m so confused. I didn’t open this for a couple weeks after getting it while I was finishing my last bottle. The seal on the bottle was intact. Unfortunately now I’m outside of my window to return.This was the worst experience ever. At first it was bright purple, for a few days. But even while purple… it felt clumpy and silicone-like.

It just breaks into smaller chunks and won’t stick to your teeth.I included a video of how it has turned brown and continues to stay that way no matter how much I pump out of it… looks like it’s oxidized?

I also didn't realize until I READ on the product info itself that the effects you might get if you're lucky will be for ""that day only""... purple cancels out yellow or something like that. This is a gimmick and was a complete and total waste of my good money. Can I get my money back? Please, I bought 2 bottles. I can send them both back one unopened.",1
The purple toothpaste does not dissolve (lather up). Good fall into sink from mouth while brushing.The purple color makes it appear whiter for a few moments only. Used for about 2 weeks. Waste,1
Don’t buy this buy Mint InstantPurple Color Corrector with nHAp. I haven’t bleached my teeth in a year since using that. I tried this to save money big mistake. This doesn’t even bring out the white at nothing. Plus the dispenser pull gadget inside became unhooked so it doesn’t work I have to shake the paste out after four days. Pure garbage.,1
I tried this product and can confirm that it does not preform as advertised. Day to day use did nothing to help improve the look of my teeth.If anyone has had any experience that was better than mine then great for you.,1
This product rendered useless as the product doesn’t pump out and there was no straw in the pump like most purple teeth whitening products in this category.,1
An explosion of toothpaste from every crevice but the one intended,1
It’s either very loose or just doesn’t fit. Trash.,1
I tried this product hoping it would do what it says. But I didn't notice any change at all. This was a waste of my money.,1
Received the tube- it felt liquid when I picked it up to use- so I shook it quite a bit. Opened a bunch of liquid squinted out everywhere. put cap back on and shock it- get a little bit of pasty white material like toothpaste. Has been ongoing issue- tube usually only squirts liquid so it does not stick to toothbrush. Can't return it. Waste of Money. Going to make m y own!,1
"This was our favorite toothpaste. Long lasting clean feeling and nice minty gel flavor. Since crest added the tarter protection (in very small print), the toothpaste is watery, no gel minty taste and doesn't clean as it did before. I bought Colgate for the first time ever. Just not the same.",1

"I was only able to use this product once and then it stopped working. It was great the one time I used it as it helped flush out my ear as I had an ear infection. I have charged it, the light turns from red to green and when I go to use it, it doesn't turn on.",1
"I purched this item along with some of the Pink Stuff, and did not use the brush before my return date expired. When I loaded the batteries it failed to turn on. OK, Pionk Stuff produce is good, so I order a second brush and when it arrived the packaging was damaged, but I tired it anyway just to see if this one worked. Same issue - unit would not start. Changed the batteries and it still would not start. Sending the 2nd one back for a replacement and will see how that works out. If it doesn't start I will just return it and look for another option. Obviously the manufacturing quality control is missing...",1
"I have used the attachment specifically to clean dirty grout in my tile floors and that was barely works. It comes with a lot of attachments for other types of cleaning I haven't tried them yet, but feels cheap...",1

"The product was good in concept, however, the head of the product keeps coming unscrewed from the pole, no matter how hard I tighten it. It doesn't get in the grooves very well. Seems like it would be great for someone it just need minor surface dust removed and does it on a very regular basis. But built up dust and dirt only gets moved around. Sad I spent the money in it. 😒",1
This product is AWFUL! It DOES NOT PEEL OFF easily or in one piece. I tried it last week and followed the instructions. It took my 45 minutes to peel tiny little pieces off before I just got in the shower to wash it all off. Last night I decided to give a second chance and left it on much longer this time allowing it to set. SAME issue. I was smarter this time though and did not spend all that time picking at it. It also made my skin much more irritated.,1

These do not work at all! I wish I did not have to give them any stars! I need anywhere between a .5 to 1.25 reader depending on whether I’m wearing my contacts or not so I was so excited to try these. I put them on and could not read ANYTHING! They were so blurry. I kept them on for a bit to see if they’d adjust and they never changed at all. They are going back and I am leaving this review so no else wastes their time or money on these.,1
"These are cheap, I guess you get what you pay for. They fit over glasses and do provide a view while laying flat. However it is very uncomfortable on your face and disorienting because of how the reflection is displayed, and I don't know if I just received a bad pair but the lenses were scratched. Also, they can't be returned, I don't know if there's a better option but this pair is not a good one.",1
"Too heavy to use,not good for Using laptop. It adds extra pain in your reading during lying in bed.",1
My lens fell out. Within my first minute of having it. The lens just fell out.,1
I got these for reading and they were so insanely heavy they caused a headache right away. I returned them.,1
We followed the instructions but this does not stick on with water as promised. Then when we went to return them we dicovered that the return window was only a month — since we weren’t going on vacation until next week we didn’t try putting them in and it expired by a week. :(,1
Feel cheaply made and a little heavy. Difficult to use if you wear glasses already. Have to lie way back or hold book way down at an odd angle to use well.,1
Poor quality didn’t expect much but didn’t expect this cheap. Like something you’d win at skee ball!,1
"The picture represents the glasses as is. i.e. The Bifocal piece is just that, a glued on bifocal. Too small. The sunglasses were very light and flimsy. Would not recommend.",1
I ordered these to better able to see my instruments while riding my motorcycle. They are hard for me to see anything through top or bottom. Not a good choice for me.,1
"The description of this product says ""Fits most glasses."" ON WHAT PLANET???Total waste of money.",1
"I have narrow eyeglasses and these sit in the top third of those lenses. They are basically unusable. The picture online doesn't show a correct image. I would guess it was placed with a distortion. It doesn't show how really narrow, top to bottom, these clip-ons really are. I don't know what to do with them. I guess I'm just out the money.",1
Make sure you know your range. I needed a higher range than what was advertised.,1
"Hinges break in two weeks ,they are very weak",1
Love the thought of the multi vision however the plastic lenses that I received were foggy and barely useful. It’s unfortunate as I did purchase a pair locally and had I not lost them… they were clear and functional.,1
It's a great item it's just that I can't use it with the lens scratched.,1
I don’t write reviews typically but these were pretty bad. Besides being scratched on one lense they were very poor quality. I paid much more than I usually do for a cheap pair of reading glasses and they were comically bad. Creaking plastic frames that were not angled correctly (too wide) when open so that I had to bring them back in to meet my head. Loose lenses that were not fit well to the frame. Not asking for much but for around $25 I expected them to at least be usable. Also suspect I’m not the first to return this pair.,1
"First it arrived much later than expected. It was just packed in a clear plastic bag, no cover at all. Then I went to open the arms to try them on and the hinge broke. Very disappointed. Had wanted to have a retro looking pair of reading glasses, I guess it wasn’t meant to be.",1
I bought two pairs and both broke from normal wear.No return option.Waste of money.Bad product!,1
Broke within a couple weeks of light use. Disposable quality.,1
"I bought these again because the side ear pieces stretched and I needed a new pair. Its been less than a year, and I ordered these again and the quality of the glass is horrible. DISTORTED! When I look down it makes me feel like Im 2 ft from the ground and I am not a toddler. Something really wrong with these.",1
Sorry but they don't work.,1
"The stems are somewhat short and the lens frame is a bit delicate (not surprising given the website photos and the fact that their wireframes), but the glasses are nice and lightweight. Unfortunately, the magnifying strength of the lens is a bit weak. I ordered a 2.0 lens and received them labelled at 2.0, but they seem closer to a 1.75, meaning they're a bit soft in terms of focus.",1
Disliked seeing fuzzy put over prescription glasses for the computer @ work I can see clear,1
"They do have lights. They are cute. But I got a book out in bed, which is why I wanted these, and put on these glasses to aide. I had to turn on light from iPhone to see the words. Hugely disappointed.",1
The attachment of the temple hinges is defective. I was replacing a broken pair I had for several years on which the hinges fit properly. Both replacement pairs have the same problem. I feel that these will break in a short period of time.I would recommend not ordering these glasses.,1
"I didn't like the glasses because it seems like the lens are inserted upside down! It is very difficult to see, I turned the glasses upside down on my face and now I can see close up!",1
The lenses and price on these glasses are awesome BUT I will not recommend as the frames break very easily when cleaning and I went through both pairs in 2 months so with that said I will never buy these again.,1
"Cheap packaging, arrived with right lens off",1
Avoid. The tag on the glasses marked them as defective store seconds. The lenses were scratched. To return them Amazon wants me to drive to a store many miles away.,1
"Worst readers that I have ever owned. Cheap frames designed to fit Shrek's head, so they fall off normal sized head, and optical quality is terrible. Don't waste your money.",1
"I'm not that gentle with eyewear, so should avoid plastic frames. Temple hinge broke off the rim.",1
These glasses are supposed to be adjusted for the user’s vision. The frames and lenses were cheaply made and I could not adjust them to improve my vision. Sent them back. Would not recommend anyone to purchase these glasses.,1
Do not waste your time and money on this expensive gimmick. IT'S WORTHLESS!!!,1
They're so poorly made it probably cost them less than $1 to make them. And look what they're selling them for! And they don't even work. Junk! Junk,1
"Not useful per any one need more 1.5 and only small face can use ,,,, very bad quality",1
Way too heavy,1
"Received April 30, 2023. Broke trying to put them on July 19, 2023. They have been carefully kept in the case. Never handled by children. The case has held up better. Would not recommend.",1
I liked the glasses but after 2 months the arm broke right near the screw where the metal part of the arm meets the plastic ear piece. So disappointed.,1
Product has a larger span than earlier 1001 versions and slips off constantly. Not a good fit and not comfortable. Not adjustable without breaking it.,1
Wrong reader strength!!!!,1
"I have worn prescription eyeglasses for years and have had to adjust the arm ‘width’ (slowly, gradually and carefully) many times. I also know when I cannot make the adjustment myself and require professional assistance. I attempted a minor single arm procedure on these so they would not slide forward when I lean forward. And they snapped at the left lens holding area where no adjustment was being attempted.The natural tortoise colour I selected is a quite handsome frame. Their magnification might be a tad more than their spec, but if so it seems to make them even better readers for me. You need to know that the round lens size is small, but John Lennon would probably have loved them. I enjoyed having them sitting quite comfortably towards the end of my nose to allow an easy switch from the TV to lap computer without missing a beat. Larger lens/frames would not allow for this wearing option so they have a distinct advantage for me. I have mentioned elsewhere I have come to regard reading glasses from Amazon as expendable throwaways. Since they cost so little and look so good, I just try to have an extra pair on hand. Usually something different to try. But that was when I got at least several months wear from them…not just a week or 2. I think I’m glad in any event that I only wear them to read at home, or after arrival at a destination requiring reading. I’m sure I would not want the obvious risks associated with a deploying airbag while wearing them. -max",1
The left glass has a blurred line inside it. In addition the size of the glasses was very small.,1
Broke at the hinge after less than two months of use - not even used daily. But the multipacks of readers. At least then you won’t be mad if you only paid $5 for something that breaks after two months,1
These glasses don't bend. I got them and the frames are warped. They slide off my nose if I look down. I will be returning these once I get back home from work this weekend,1
"#1 the photochromic affect is not dark enough for me, only a light gray. #2 the magnify area is way too narrow, requiring too much head turning. #3 the plastic is cheap, like dollar store stuff. #4 the hinge is not very springy.",1
Only used the glasses for less than a week when the nose pad fell off.,1
The glasses are not calibrated to the center to center of your eyes. The fact is that all folks eyes are not the same distance apart. This makes them blurry. Very lightweight and fit decent. Just don’t expect them to be perfect.,1
Do not show your and far you only get closer or far away does not do both,1
Does not correct vision,1
"This product does not work blury far blury near, request money back.",1
Blurry at a distance,1
"I ordered this DeLonghi 14,000 BTU air conditioner with UV-Carelight on August 11th 2021 and it cooled quickly in a 92 degree large open space. But, as you can see from the photo, it now sits outside with a cut cord waiting to go to the dump.In October I turned on the unit for its UV properties and it worked for a couple of days until the fan started to make a loud screeching sound. I unplugged the unit and called DeLonghi Customer Service (CS) who asked me to make a video of the fan noise so they could evaluate the problem. I could not duplicate the problem, so I didn't send the video assuming it had self-corrected..In June 2022 (after just a few days of AC use when I bought it) I set up the unit and turned on the air conditioner. The fan blew air, but the compressor never turned on and the unit went off and on at will. It blew hot air!I called customer service with the reasonable assumption that DeLonghi would send a new replacement. I provided a video and cut the cord as instructed since they don't retrieve broken air conditioners. However, although 100% on my side, CS said the Company's policy is to replace the unit with a reconditioned one that may or may not be the same color or have the same features, and whose warranty continues with the existing purchase.CS contacted his manager at my request for a new unit with new warranty because it was used less than a month, and the answer was ""no."" I asked him whether there was someone else who could evaluate the situation and that person said OK to a new unit, same as I bought, but warranty continues from original purchase date. There were no refurbished machines available. The CS and I agreed this is the best we could do so I compromised. CS said he would follow through so the process moves ASAP and I'm sure to get a new unit. Since DeLonghi doesn't accept returns of broken units I asked CS how they get the A/Cs for refurbishments. In the worst-possible consumer scenario, where do the refurbs come from?? Well, they're the ones that ""fall"" off the truck when being delivered and therefore not accepted by the customer. Dings and bangs. Yup!!WHAT???!!! I just spent $645 for this barely-used air conditioner (minus money Amazon reimbursed me to buy dust covers that were advertised [at the time] as included but neither Amazon CS nor I could convince DeLonghi to send them) and countless h-o-u-r-s searching Amazon for the right free-standing air conditioner to meet our needs.A week later I received a notice that the label was created for ""new"" AC from DeLonghi. At this writing, it's two weeks and no sign of shipment. By now, the temperature in the Great Room is close to 90 degrees. So...I call Amazon CS and within 20 minutes I've 'returned' the AC and received a refund so this week I will have a functional AC and maybe two for a second room. Amazon Customer Service Rocks! It may be the last vestige of Corporate customer service.",1
"I don't usually write reviews, but I'm doing this out of a sense of responsibility. These De'Longhi ACs have a major design flaw that will result in your floors being flooded and damaged. The worst part is, that De'Longhi is well aware of this problem and continues to ship the product.My photos here basically tell the story. These units are designed to literally sit on the plastic water tank. Instead of having a metal bottom with casters (and the tank inside the unit), the tank is directly at the bottom of the unit and the casters are attached to it. This results in a lot of pressure and stress on the plastic, mostly from the weight of the unit, but also due to how the plastic is attached internally.As you can see this results in the plastic cracking, which allows the water in the tank to pour out. These units produce a lot of condensation, and it only takes a few hours of running to flood your floors. I discovered this the hard way. We had so much water leak out of this tank that it drenched our carpet and the subfloor. It actually damaged our house, and we spent a week trying to dry the carpet and padding out. We probably have mold now as a result.These units are literally shipping out with this defect. It arrived at my home this way, but we didn't know because the crack was underneath. It wasn't until our floor had been soaked numerous times that we realized there was a major problem. By the time the crack was discovered, the damage had been done.This is not an isolated incident. If you read through the reviews here you'll see this is a common and known issue. In fact, when I contacted De'Longhi support about this it was obvious that they had many customers with the same problem. They shipped me out a replacement under the warranty, and guess what, it has the same problem!Look at the last two photos I've attached, and you'll see there are stress marks (white marks) in the plastic in the identical location of the unit that had the crack. This replacement unit has the same problem, and is a ticking time bomb waiting to crack in the same location.This is a stupid design flaw on an otherwise very nice unit. Why they are not making these with metal bottoms is beyond me. My guess is they are being very cheap about it. I have another De'Longhi AC from years ago, and it also has a plastic bottom. My guess is they are saving more money than they are losing from this issue.Dealing with De'Longhi support is a nightmare. You will spend at least 30-45 minutes on hold. When you finally get someone they will only offer a replacement. They will not refund under any circumstance. In my case they offered me a 4th unit and I laughed. I've had 3 defective units from De'Longhi. The first one shipped out with an assembly defect in the outer casing. The second one had the cracked bottom, and the third unit has the stress cracks in the same spot.By the time you realize you have an issue your only choice is to go through De'Longhi support. Amazon will not refund past 30 days. In my case I've had 4 months of replacements and no one will refund me, not De'Longhi or Amazon. I'm left with a unit that will likely split open at the bottom in a matter of days or weeks.De'Longhi does not care about their customers. I've spoken with them many times, and it is clear they only care about their bottom line. They are basically committing fraud here by shipping these units out with clear knowledge they crack and leak. They just don't care!They also have an absurd policy that requires you to cut the power cord on replaced units and send that photo to them in order for the warranty to be maintained on the replacement. This forces you to then pay to dispose of the defective unit. In my case I just glued the plastic bottom using a plastic epoxy and then sold the repaired unit. I just couldn't throw out a unit that was working perfectly except for the crack. What a waste that would be!If you do end up in my situation you can repair the cracked plastic by using J-B Weld PlasticWeld Super Strength Epoxy (sold by Ace Hardware). It will completely seal the crack and dries harder than the original plastic.Beyond that, I recommend staying away from De'Longhi and these AC units in particular (unless you prefer cracks and leaks).De'Longhi, shame on you for this!",1
Bought in late June. Worked great for the summer heat and also ran the heat a few times in the fall. Sound was not bad at all and everything worked great. Now it is late fall and AC and heat both don't work. Turns on and fan kicks in but no heat or cool air .I can't afford the hundreds of dollars it will take to send it back to be fixed. Very upset.,1
We had a previous one and it was great.Wanted a new one but lost in shipping so we canceled order.Daughter took old one when she moved out and that one still works great. It was three years old.,1
I should of listened to the reviews! Unit made loud noise then AC mode stopped working only Fans Work.... It didn't even last couple minutes. Defective batch were bought.,1
"There are a few glaring issues with this product1. The unit vibrates violently. If any tube/wheel/fan/vent is slightly out of place it will sound like a mid-sized motorcycle is revving inside your room. Every time I turn it on I have to press and lift various parts of the unit until I find out what is causing the noise before taping or angling it in a way that makes is quieter.2. The draining system is a massive design flaw. There are two separate compartments that hold water. The top compartment, which gathers water in the ""dehumidifier"" mode and the bottom department which gathers water in the ""cooling"" mode. Neither compartment is removable, so be prepared to lift the 100 lb unit to the bathtub to drain, or hold it 2 ft in the air above a bucket.3. The unit floods itself into turning off every hour in cooling mode. The user manual states that the unit should not collect water in cooling mode, but if if is an extremely humid environment it may turn off automatically and show a water warning. This happens every hour. I have triple checked that the fan is set up with the tubing at the suggested height, and it isn't extended more than 2 ft. I live in the notoriously dry state of Colorado, so humidity is not the problem. I have a similar standing AC unit in the next room over that has had no trouble dispelling the water up the tube for the past 3 months, but this one can not seem to last over an hour without turning off and needing drained.I purchased at around $270, which was 40% off at the time. Now I understand why it was marked so low. I recognized the brand name ""Honeywell"" and hoped for better, but was very disappointed.",1
I bought this one early before summer and I'm glad I did because I knew they'd sell out. But the problem is I'm missing some parts. One of them is #2 window panel bracket adapter and #5 plastic pin and the manuel. I was planning on using it this week because we have a heat wave coming but I cannot put it together properly. I finally set it up when it got hot which I should have done it in the very beginning but I did not. When I put it together I turned it on it made the most horrible noise only to find out that there was a piece of plastic broken off from the inside and now it is completely unusable I can't even use the fan. Unfortunately I'm stuck with it and I can't return it and I don't know if I can even go to Honeywell to get the someone to fix it. It definitely wasn't wasted money.,1
"This review is for the Midea Duo. I bought this because I needed a portable AC for one of the bedrooms in my condo because the central air is inadequate. I especially wanted a smart AC so that I could use it with my Alexa ecosystem. Unfortunately, despite the good looks, quiet operation and good build quality, this thing has some major shortcomings that make it unusable and a complete waste of money.For starters, I received it with one of the tabs used to hold the hose in place on the window slider broken. Therefore, I needed a replacement part but Amazon doesn’t carry parts, so they had to send me a while new unit so that I could return the unit with the broken part. This delayed its use. Amazon was good about it so I don’t have any complaints there.The first major issue I have is with the window slider itself, a part that must be used in order to use the AC. For starters, you’d expect a $600 AC to come with high quality accessories but this part is cheaply made, flimsy and thin with absolutely no insulation properties at all. Furthermore, once assembled the sides are not flat, so you are left with gaps between the flat surfaces of the window and the sliders. They give you foam tape to adhere to the edges but this is inadequate. You’re left with a window insert that not only gets hot, but also lets bugs in and sound/ outside noise. The other issue with the slider is that for some stupid reason, they placed the hole for the exhaust hose very close to one edge. Its so close that when you use the sliding window adapter, it hits the sill and cannot snap into place. You have to build it out on that sure to get it to work. Why wouldn’t they just have centered it!? Furthermore, the hose is huge, probably twice the width of standard units and it’s unwieldy, so as gentle as I was being with this thing, one of the tabs broke (again!) and now it won’t connect properly … I had to glue it on with ABS cement so it doesn’t pull out. Unfortunately, due to the uncommon shape of the hose, you cannot upgrade to something else and you are left trying to modify it. Fine, I took two 1x2” wooden rails and created a box to support the sliders and added styrofoam to insulate it.Unfortunately, the second major problem is that this unit does nothing for the humidity while in AC mode because it reuses the condensation to make it more efficient… but, even though I have this thing keeping the room at 68 degrees, it jacked the humidity up to 84%! So the air is really dense and because of this it’s uncomfortable and useless! Unfortunately because of all the time it took to get this thing situated, Ive missed the return window by several days and now I’m out $600!I highly recommend staying away from this product. I really wanted to love it but instead I loathe it!Pros: good build quality of the AC unit itself, wifi and smart app enabled, quiet, blows a good amount of air.Cons: huge unwieldy exhaust hose, cheaply made and poorly designed hose adapter, cheaply made and poorly designed window sliders.",1
"I purchased this product on April 23 ,2021 and paid $717.04 . It was for our bedroom and it is only used during the warmer months (June to end of August ) and only at night . I took it out yesterday June 26 ,2023 for the first time this year and the unit is not cooling ! I did all that was recommended as per the manual( trouble shooting ) and it still did not provide any cool air . A diagnostic revealed that there was a gas leak and it is not repairable . The type of gas is R-410A and is now illegal to use as it is extremely flammable . I contacted Delonghi and was told that the 2 year warranty had expired 2 months ago and there was nothing they could do ! Pretty poor service and how are you suppose to know if the unit was not working in April when there is still snow on the ground . If You add up all the hours that this unit was used it is not a very good investment !",1
"I used to have one of these that worked wonderfully. Same brand and everything which is why I got it. This one does NOT cool at all and if anything just makes the room more humid. Im going to try to get a dehumidifier (though I’m in SoCal so it’s not very wet to begin with) to see if that works along side with this, and if it doesn’t, I’ll have to consider jumping in front of a train because I CANNOT with this heat. By the time that arrives, it’ll probably be too late to send this over priced piece of junk back, if that was ever even an option anyway.",1
Defective immediately on arrival. Felt like it was just a fan. Took cover off to see the pump unable to get water up the tube. Once emptied and flipped over the fan started rattling and I can hear something in it. Total rip off.,1
"It is just an expensive loud fan which makes your place too humid. If you are looking for something to make your hot place too humid and noisy, go for it, because it is not an air cooler. I return it.",1
"We did not have the cooler for very long time and the motor went out, and my husband called the company and the man he spoke to was not very friendly, he said how do you know it is the motor well he know all those thing I think he finely said okay we will send you another one well we have not got it yet .

I would like to have access to a process to return this product.,1
"This portable AC could easily be the poster child for the ""portable air conditioners are highly/the most inefficient air conditioning option"" OR ""portable air conditioners are the air conditioners of last resort"" statement(s).So, this AC was meant for a room under 200 sq. ft., but, because it has some computer equipment in it which generates SOME heat (we're talking high end laptop, not server room), I got this unit for a space almost 4x the square footage of the room. So here are my observations:• Window installation kit should include foam & weather stripping because there are a LOT of gaps left when provided equipment is installed. They don't address these at all! I mean, at least note the need for this before the poor sap (customer) begins the installation process.• Plastic panels.... Well, one side is nice, solid, thick, plastic, & leaves narrow gaps.... The other side is thin, flimsy plastic that not only heats up just from the outside heat, but also leaves a total of 1/2"" worth of gaps... As I noted before, the install kit includes not a darn thing to address this with. The panels warm up (as plastic will) from the ambient air outdoors (especially when installed in a sunny window) AND one side also warms up from the exhaust (making it a double whammy). Before you start installing anything, do yourself the favor of taking measurements and purchasing foam insulation -- best in sheet form so you can cut to sizes you need! AND you will need weather stripping to apply above and below the edges of the plastic panels to best deal with the gaps. The plastic, in fact, heats up so much from the outside, that it actually requires the use of thermal heat shielding on the outward facing surface AND insulation on the interior facing surface. They don't tell you that so you can have everything at the ready before you start the install project --- which is far more involved that the simple set of instructions would lead you to believe.• Note that installation will leave you with a security risk with most types of windows because there is no provision made for dealing with the fact that your window will no longer stay properly closed (much less lock).• This thing generates heat! In initial hours of operation, as is recommended for most ACs & dehumidifiers, it's best to run them on the highest fan & lowest temp. settings. Which is where I started.... Well, the back of the unit heated up like crazy -- almost too hot to keep a hand on. I stuck with it, though, since the room was already warm anyway.... After about 5hrs. of continuous operation it settled into a pattern and ran cooler --- lukewarm or so. But, it still generates heat, which compounds the warmth in the room especially with prolonged use, which means the unit has to fight itself as well as the room conditions. The very definition of inefficient!• The exhaust tube reaches surface temps. in excess of 120˙F. A Cool-Aide insulation kit is a MUST! With the kit installed, the exhaust hose surface temp. stays a bit above the room temp. Without it, there is no way this unit could cool a shoe box! Even with it, the areas where the exhaust hose connects to the unit & where it connects to the window panels are a point of heat getting released into the room you're trying to cool. Again, the very definition of inefficient! In fact, insulating the tube with a thermal/heat barrier & THEN sliding it into the Cool-Aide sleeve is your best option -- cuts the tube's radiant heat to near 0. But, no matter what you do, the exhaust tube's connection points cannot be insulated. Nowhere in the manuals or product descriptions will you see that addressed either! These machines should ALL come with insulating sleeves -- they simply will not cool a room they are sitting in without it & yet none of them come with this critical equipment.• Because of the heat the unit generates along the surfaces near & around the exhaust port (which cannot be insulated in any way), the room temp. NEVER got below 74˙F. In a small room, the unit loses the battle against the heat it generates & it simply doesn't have enough cooling power for even the room size it is rated for. Keep in mind, it wasn't able to get a ~200 sq. foot room below 74 degrees... And even that achievement came only when the unit's fan was at its lowest setting.... So what hope is there of cooling a 400 sq. ft. space?• Noise..... Much noisier than you expect upon reading the decibel ratings. Especially in small rooms. You can't hear yourself think with the fan set to ""high"". And it's not likely to win the battle between the heat in the room & the heat it itself generates on low.... Maybe on medium. When all that is taken into account, the unit is noisy.• Weight..... Be prepared for 10+lbs of added weight from the packing material alone. And, while it IS one of the lightest such units on the market, it's an unwieldy weight. There aren't actual handles for moving the unit as much as grooves in the design you can kind of get your fingertips into if you have ""smallish"" hands. I'll tell you this much, it was a pain getting it up a flight of stairs! Not because of the weight alone, but because it was hard to get a hold of the thing. I have a dehumidifier that weighs about the same as this unit that is FAR easier to move because it has handholds along the top of two sides. Without handholds, this unit is much more difficult to move than you'd expect.• Cold humidity.... That's what you get.... It started off with a room at 86˙F (thank you heat wave) at 40% humidity. It managed to get the room to 74˙F (though set to 67) at 60% humidity.... Which makes no sense for something with a built in dehumidifier & is self-evaporative too! The humidity level should have at the very least remained at 40%. So, what I am dealing with now is a cool, clammy, humid feeling room. Better than hot, humid, clammy -- which is insufferable to me & affects my health -- but definitely will not do in the long run.• Unsightly when set up as needed.... With the addition of the necessary insulation sleeve, this unit doesn't look anywhere near as neat and tidy as the product pictures would lead you to believe.• Takes up virtually as much space as a window unit with the same effect. Aside from the new U shaped window & new saddle window units on the market, these portable units' exhaust setup will take up almost as much space as a window unit for the same-sized room with the added security risk that is much more difficult to address than for a true window unit.... The plastic is too flimsy on this portable unit's exhaust setup to allow for sufficient pressure application to make the window truly secure. A true window unit is much sturdier & allows for windows to be secured in place without worry of breaking brittle plastic panels.• Moving it room to room will not be as easy as it sounds either. You have to go through the while rigamarole of dealing with the gaps with the exhaust panels every time. Not to mention finding a solution for securing the windows each time you move the unit.Any pros., you ask? Well.... It's easy enough to assemble -- consists of just attaching the hose. The controls are big, easy to read, and intuitive -- don't really need a manual to operate it. The castor wheels' design allows for easy movement of the unit even on carpet.My advise...... Window units are indeed better. More of a pain with removal for the season, but definitely not more of an effort to install (when figuring in all the material deficiencies with this unit) and they don't add any of their operating heat back into the environment they are cooling. Second to those are in-wall or through-the-wall units. Third are units that sit outside in the elements (they can be as problematic, though in different & more costly ways, as portable units in my experience). I've now had all three types & can whole heartedly agree with professional assessments of them & rank them the same way. I have a through-the-wall unit that is now 15+ years old (and about to be replaced) that, in all those years, hasn't given me even half the issues I've had with this portable unit did in just ONE day of use. No way this unit would give you that many years of consistent, trouble-free cooling as its window & through-the-wall counterparts -- probably marginally less headaches & expense than external options.I will be sending this thing back from whence it came.... And replacing it within a few days with a window unit. Don't get me wrong, I'm not advertising for window ACs.... I'd MUCH rather work with easily removable exhaust tubes and stuff, but these portable units are indeed incredibly inefficient. One tube, twin tube, the same issues which need to be addressed the same way. They are simply not worth the money, nor the hassle. And they are no more portable, in general, than fixed units simply because of their weight.In conclusion.... Count the true costs before purchasing any portable AC. Stay away from this one in general....If you took the time to read all this, God bless =) And I hope you found it worthwhile in the end.",1
"Update Year 3. My girlfriend asked on a hot day, why aren't you using the swamp cooler. So I cleaned it off and filled it up. Oh yeah the pump doesn't work. It probably stopped working the first year which is why I didn't use it since then. At first I was pleased that it had stopped dumping water out of the back, but this was only because the pump was failing.So I ordered a replacement pump. No refunds on the pump. Honeywell must know what junk this thing is. I took off the back and thought well, I'll also fix the depth indicator (this had never been installed. Impossible to get to. I want to just throw the whole thing out (and never buy another Honeywell anything ever again). But I can't cancel the pump I ordered yesterday that won't arrive for for another 10 days. (They claim it was already shipped. I ordered it 6 pm Saturday, it's 3:30 pm Sunday)Update: 1 Year. It leaks out of the soaker frame in the back-all over the floor. Can only be used outside. No reason this suddenly started happening. It's not an easy fix. The low fill door and missing water level gauge has been a huge annoyance. It would have been so easy to put a large funnel on the top for filling. There are inexplicable button combinations that disable speed. Default On is fan, not cooling. Bottomline? This unit just seems badly designed in many wrong ways. Update: One month. Cleaning. There doesn't seem to be anyway, other than through the fill door to get my hand, and a sponge to the bottom of the tank. There seems to be no instructions for cleaning it out. TIP: before buying any evaporative cooler Google how to clean it first. Honeywell only seems to have marketing happy talk. General instructions for this type of cooler are not useful because there's no way to get inside this model. I've only run reverse osmosis water, and ran maybe 12 gallons through in the past month, last weekend after I filled it up I noticed gunk floating around in the water. So it needs cleaning out on a regular basis. Not a big deal-- if you can gain access.Old review: I just received this and got it working. What I immediately noticed: Instead of one useless user manual, there are two. There's also a Honeywell video, don't bother: You already know what a swamp cooler does. You can read the buttons on the top of the machine. That's all the video covers. A complete waste of time.What is the capacity of this? I think it's about 6 gallons, but I couldn't find anything in the manuals or the website that cover this.The water level window seems pretty useless (that's because the indicator needle is sitting loose on the bottom of the tank. ) I put in at least three gallons and it doesn't even register at the Minimum.It takes a lot of water, but the water intake door is just OK at best. They could've easily designed a huge funnel as the side panel to raise the point you add water, and so you could add water as fast as you can pour. ) It cools by adding water to the air, that water evaporates which requires heat, so the air cools. If you use this in a closed room, the humidity will rise to the saturation point and no more cooling will occur. I'm using this in Los Angeles where humidity levels are 45% to 60%, though the first day I used this the report was 84%. It's worked pretty good across this range. The output fan is strong, the output temperature is about 10 degrees F below the temperature of the intake air. It sits next to an open door, so it's not recirculating room air. This should give you an idea of how well this will work.It sits near where I work on my computer, at low the air flow is pretty high, so if you need a swamp cooler for just one person in one basic position, then this unit is probably too large 500 CFM, half would probably do it.I remain annoyed about the fill method and it arriving with a broken fill level indicator. (Using the levered needle is pretty stupid design. The fill level window is very low on the unit. There's a float right next to this stupid fill level window. So why even use a float and a lever if the level window is so low on the unit???? With a float or levered indicator needle it would be dead simple to show the level right at the top of the unit where it could be easily read. Also the ice compartment at the top. It would not be at all difficult to add a little flap and make this the fill point-it's huge compared to the stupid little flap on the side. Anyone at Honeywell paying attention????)",1
"this machine does not cool, does not work, received defective machine, waste of money",1
"I purchased this in May 2016 to cool a small 14 x 6 server room that has two ThinkServers and a few switches -enough heat buildup to be a issue but not enough to expect cooling to be a major problem.The first unit died in about 3 months, and Tripp Lite support was kind enough to ship a replacement unit. This cost me $50 in shipping & a week without cooling but I did learn some things which may help you.First, while speaking to tech support, I found out that this unit is only designed to run 4-6 hours per day. That could be a problem when it's 100 degrees outside, the office A/C is off for the weekend, your servers are spewing heat, and the temp is set to 65 on the SRCOOL12k. Lesson: The office A/C is still going to have to take on the majority of the cooling work.Second lesson. I had the first unit set to ""high"" and the thermostat set about 4 degrees cooler than the office A/C. I assumed it would cool down & then run intermittently after that. I was wrong. It ran constantly. I believe the issue is that it exhausts so much air from the room that it is constantly sucking in warmer air from the office & can never get ahead of itself. I now have the fan set to low & it seems to be doing a much better job.Third lesson. If you live in an area where humidity is a problem, run the hose. We bought into the marketing that this would evaporate the humidity in the exhaust. It overflowed on the weekend & made a mess. After that we ran a drain hose & it's worked well since.Fourth lesson. The SNMP module for this thing made it a lot more complicated than it was worth. Even after you get past the fact that you need an old in-secure version of java to run it, it seems to get confused. Simple is better. I removed the SNMP kit & am just letting it run with the front panel controls. I'll find another gizmo to monitor the temp & alert.Last recommendation: based on the first one dying after 3 months, buy the extended warranty.I considered numerous residential/commercial air conditioning units but went with this one because it seemed to be designed for the IT environment. I therefore assumed that it would offer better reliability & better controls than the other A/C units, especially with the SNMP module. I was wrong. I have other Tripp Lite equipment that works well but this is tarnishing the brand. I believe I would have been as well off or better off with one of the $400 units from the big box home improvement store.Summary: When it works it works acceptably well. Documentation is average at best. Some best practices/scenarios would really have helped. Support was good. If you are cooling racks there is likely value in the tubing that they provide to duct air into the rack. If you are just cooling a room like me you can likely get more cooling for your buck with a standard air conditioner.*** Update ***The replacement unit died in September 2017. No one fixes them, the factory warranty was over so I filed a claim on the extended warranty. Kudos to Square Trade, they don't fix them either but they did issue a check for the purchase price. I bought another room air conditioner at the local home improvement store for a couple hundred dollars less than this unit. Frankly the new one is doing a better job of cooling. We'll see if it lasts longer.",1
"I purchased this machine 13 months ago. I maybe used it 8 times. It no longer blowed cold air. I called multiple Amana service numbers which were unable to help. I finally spoke to someone who said this machine is only covered for 12 months, so I should just call a repairman. They honestly couldn’t even walk me through any troubleshooting. Even when it worked it was VERY loud. Don’t waste your money.",1
"I bought this portable air conditioner for my cabin. I rarely needed to use it but when it was extremely hot I needed something to cool the cabin down. So I bought it in 2020 but used it a total of 8-9 times. This year I turned it on and it blew hot air only. I have always done everything the manufacturer said to do (clean the filter, drain the unit, etc.) and it still quit. Good luck finding someone to repair one of these units.",1
"*Update - the company has been unhelpful and outright lazy in trying to troubleshoot my unit not working. They asked me to ship the unit back for repairs. If anyone has guessed, the cost of packaging and shipping something this big to another country is astronomical in comparison to the price paid for a unit that lasted about 1 year. They must know their product is no good - hence the 1 year warranty on the unit and the measly 3 year on the converter. From what I’ve seen from other’s experiencing the same - especially in Canada - this item will cost you SO much more than the price tag and a lot of headaches. Not to mention being down almost a grand and without AC in the middle of summer. You’ve been warned*Worked great last summer. Maintained it well, stored approximately over winter. Took it out this spring and it worked for 2 months before it completely stopped cooling the air. Follower all the troubleshooting and contacted the company who refuses to speak on the phone. After 6 “troubleshooting” emails back and forth, I’m still stuck with a glorified fan in the middle of summer. I’d expect a lot more support and performance after spending almost a thousand dollars. Buyer beware",1
"The media could not be loaded. Initially, I love the product it is very cold. The description is correct as far as the cooling on the downside the bottom drips. initially, I love the product it is very cold. The description is correct as far as the cooling on the downside the bottom drips like crazy! When I was moving the product, I noticed my wood dresser was completely soaked. when I was moving the product, I noticed my wood dresser was completely soaked. Just be aware. You will have to have do you have a towel underneath it.",1
"Seems like just a misting fan. Water isn't especially cool. Also, the charge has never held. So it has to be plugged in at all times if you want to use it. Not as advertised. Was supposed to hold a charge for 6 hours. Not very pleased with the cost of this item. Cant even get a replacement or return at this point. :(",1
"At first the Artic Air cooler worked fine, but then after a few times of use the lights stop working and then it stopped working all together. It only has a 30 day Manufacture's warranty. We purchased in June for around 100.00 and now its Sept and it does not work. I would not recommend purchasing this outdoor cordless cooler. If you must purchase you should also purchase with a product warrantee.",1
I gave this 1 star because it arrived on time. After turning it on the first time my husband turned the off knob. It made a very loud noise & would not turn back on.,1
"No idea why it stopped working all of a sudden. Everything is clean and looks okay; it's just not cooling, It's really not worth the money even after they reduced the price.",1
"I never usually write reviews but I feel ripped off & want to help someone else find another ac unit instead of this one!!I used this occasionally for 3 summer months in 2023, I always cleaned it & put it away in an indoor closet for the fall/winter. I took it out today & it has not been blowing cool air at all. It’s recycling the air but the “cool” function is not working. I have tried everything the manual says to fix the problem with no avail. I don’t have $240 each summer to buy a new ac unit for my apartment. This should work for longer than 3 months of occupational usage considering the unit is indoors unlike most others that are exposed to the elements !Noise level- loud ! Even on the sleep setting it is noisy , you can’t hear anything over it. Which is fine for someone like me that enjoys loud fans but for my partner , they prefer it to be quiet.Installation- I have standard windows that slide up, the piece that pops into the window & then into the hose is too big . I had to duct tape it to the window sill & to the hose to hold it all into place.",1
This cooler never works and I tried to returned to get my refund I talked to Amazon they open the case with the seller but I never get any refund . I had to dispose the product and I loose 237 dollar went to the trash .very desapoint.,1
"It is a piece of junk. We had it a month and a half and on the control panel, one of the controls broke.",1
keeps dehumidfying when not set to that mode; overfills water reservoir. water reservoir cap does not stay put. Leaks all over the place. Leaking freezes. Ice covers filter. Filter freezing prevents unit from circulating air. Garbage unit useless bought in May 2023 (had some hiccups that spring thru fall where hose did not stay attached and unit leaked but OK) then was unable to use when re-installed for new season in April 2024 AT ALL.,1
A/C with USA plug. We used 2 adapters and they are burned immideately.So its unuseful. What to do?,1
I honestly don't know what the purpose of this is. I bought it because I needed a room cooled down that had no windows (if it had windows I would have used a window unit or something that could put the hot air out the window). I don't need it inside my house because we have AC. BUT instead of cooling my garage down it made it HOTTER AND SO HUMID. I work in my garage and was starting to feel sick from the heat when I realized the instructions say you can't use it in an enclosed space. It didn't say that anywhere on the page before I bought it. Now I can't even return it so I just wasted SO MUCH MONEY on something I CANT EVEN USE. Really disappointed. Hope to save people from wasting money on this in the future.,1
"Definitely not worth the money. I paid over $600.00 with taxes & bought a warranty. The exhaust is hot, but there's no where for it to go but inside. It defeats the purpose. Definitely not recommended. Especially for this outrageous price. It only points at 1 person. Ridiculous! This product needs to go back!!!",1
The fan is clicking and grinding. I have contacted the seller multiple times with no response,1
Doesn’t work and it will cost $180 to ship back. Amazon is a scam.,1
"This product is not worth the money. It is basically a fan! Does very little cooling. As a matter of fact, I couldn't tell the difference between cooling and fan cycles.Also, if you want to return it.... They charge UPS shipping and a 50% re-stocking fee!Do yourself a favor and look into other products!",1
"Barely blows out fresh air , not an AC , more like a small tiny fan for your face , cool LED lights, but I wouldn’t buy it again , it’s not a good fan",1
"I received two of this item last year, a 10k BTU and 12k BTU. The 10k one works fine, however the 12k BTU one just does not get cold anymore. I have checked everything: dust, blockages, as well as letting it go in fan mode for ~10 minutes before switching it onto cool. Nothing works. The item was described as ""excellent"" refurbished; however, when I bought it I did note on the inside some crushed in parts of the condenser. It worked last year, so I figured it was fine. Nope.I absolutely cannot recommend a product that does not do the one thing I want it to do. Especially when it is so expensive. Two stars as the other one works I guess so maybe you will get lucky and yours does not break.",1
"Refurbished, but came broken !",1
Doesn't fit on the attachment that all my other AC use. Have to return,1
Leaks water. Calling Portacool results in being on hold and then disconnection. Avoid this product and company.,1
"This unit is terrible. I usually am pretty forgiving and gracious on reviews but this unit hardly cools a 11x11 ft room and it's so loud, it sounds broken and i can hear it drom downstairs!. It's definitely not a soothing or relaxing sound. I definitely would not recommend this unit whatsoever.... too many choices to go with poorest quality product like this one. SMH",1
"This is not good for areas with high temperatures, you're better off buying a real swamp cooler! Only the top portion of the vents has airflow the bottom part is closed off so nothing comes out which limits the amount of cool air if any.",1
Remote doesn’t work. Rotation feature doesn’t work. Sleep mode is no quieter than normal mode. Water level is very difficult to see. Instructions written by a Chinese speaker and very unclear. Ice packs very small and flimsy. Operating it for one and one-half hours did not cool my bedroom even one degree.,1
"We bought this product twice. The first time in April, 2023 and the second time in June 2023. The one we bought in June has been used in our living room and up until now, it has worked amazing. No issues. Well, unfortunately today, that all changed. If we try to use the cool setting, it will automatically turn off after 1 minute with the error code “E5” on the little display. I read through the manual and nowhere does it mention the E5 Error code. I cleaned the little filters to see if maybe that would help solve the issue but no luck. It works just fine on the fan setting but not the cooling setting. Another review (From July 2024) mentioned this error code as well. They said they had to contact customer service and after struggling to get in contact, they were told that they don’t know what it means and that they just need to replace the entire unit. I just contacted support and I’m waiting to hear back, hopefully with better news than that customer received. If I get told how to fix this or they offer to replace our unit, I’ll update my review and let y’all know. As of right now though, I’m highly disappointed. When we ordered this, we paid $340. As of right now, this is not worth $340. We’ve only had this a year.",1
I received this item without the ice packs and wheels! It also didn't come with instructions on how to operate. It's pretty easy to figure it out but I like having instructions so I don't screw it up.,1
"I’m a truck driver (semitrailer) I used this item cooler inside my cab to cool down my sleeper but , the outside temperature was 80 degrees and I was sweaty with cooler works more than 2 hours with ice cold water , I can’t sleeping cause the air from cooler was hot NOT cold!.",1
"The media could not be loaded. I've had the 8K version for some time now and it's been great. It's not quiet, but it's never been annoying. I just plugged in the 12K version for a larger room and the engine has a constant chirping sound that sounds like crickets. I'm going to give it a few days to run to see if the sound peters out into something tolerable but if it keeps up I'll have to organize a return, and with a unit this large, that's going to be a real pain.Edit: If you request a return or exchange, Amazon does not offer a pick-up option. The only option is to deliver it yourself to a UPS Store, so good frickin' luck with that if you don't drive a truck. Oh, sure, you can pay UPS to come pick it up for you for an extra charge that the seller then won't reimburse you for.If the replacement unit turns out to be faulty and I have to pay UPS for two returns, I'll be reporting the seller and never buying from them again.Edit 2: The replacement unit makes the EXACT SAME metallic rattling/grinding noise that my 8000 BTU unit does not. It's so annoying that I can hear it from a completely different room. How do two different units have this exact same problem?To boot, the second unit was delivered LAYING ON ITS SIDE, which you aren't supposed to do with an AC. Nevertheless, I let it sit for more than 24 hours before testing it out. I was relieved at first when there was no grinding sound being made. Five minutes later, it won't stop. I can't tolerate it and there's no way I can sleep in a room where something is making this awful sound.",1
"We rarely give bad reviews, but the circumstances associated with this purchase have left us no alternative.We installed a new hardwood floor in our daughter’s bedroom and wanted to use a portable AC unit to cool the space.We bought a new LG 10000-BTU Inverter Portable Air Conditioner unit that is designed to shut itself off if there is a potential for leakage. The unit was installed in the bedroom and ran trouble free for several months. It was not moved from that location during this period of time.We then noticed water leakage on the new hardwood floor under the portable AC unit and immediately performed routine maintenance on the unit (cleaned filters and emptied the water collection tank). The leakage was substantial enough to cause permanent damage to the floor.To prevent further damage to the new floor we bought a drip tray to put under the unit and a leak detection system to let us know if it does leak.We then called LG Customer Service to determine why the portable AC unit did not shut itself off before leaking on the new wood flooring. After over 45 minutes of discussion, they agreed to schedule a service call by D.G. Appliance Service.A technician from D.G. Appliance Service arrived and discovered that the unit had a cracked water collection tank. He stated that he had performed repairs of cracked water collection tanks in the past but did not have the resources (helpers) to repair it now. He left without fixing the unit and reported that the unit had ""Physical Damage"" to his supervisor. He advised us to contact LG Customer Service to resolve the issue.We contacted LG Customer Service on the same day and were told that the warrantee did not apply since there was ""Physical Damage"" to the unit.We disputed the finding because the unit clearly had this damage upon arrival, and we reported it within the one-year warranty period.It took several months for the defect to manifest itself for several reasons:First, the LG technical support documentation is very explicit in their warnings that the unit is never to be laid on its side (or back) and should be kept in an upright position at all times - Otherwise, you risk damaging the cooling system. In order to have detected this damage upon shipment we would have had to lay the unit on its side to be able to visually inspect the water collection tank located at the bottom. This is exactly what the technician did to determine that the water collection tank was cracked. We had to help him support the unit in a horizontal position while he inspected the bottom of the unit with a flashlight.Second, for the first few months that the unit was operating the weather was fairly mild, and the unit was able to evaporate the condensation as it ran without having a buildup in the water collection tank. The heatwaves that started in mid-summer precipitated the condensation buildup in the unit's water collection system and led to the leakage through the cracked water collection tank.Since the unit was never moved from its initial installation location there was never an opportunity to damage the water collection tank except for in shipping or manufacturing.We were forced into buying an identical LG AC unit to replace the first leaky one since the permanent venting that we installed in our daughter’s bedroom made switching to a different brand difficult. Upon plugging the replacement unit into our wall socket the circuit breaker in our main panel tripped. No amount of re-setting the circuit breaker would cure the situation and we were forced to pay an electrician to trouble shoot and replace the circuit breaker. We immediately returned the replacement unit and received a third identical LG AC unit that appears to be working.We have contacted at least a dozen LG authorized and non-authorized repair centers to fix the first leaky unit but none of them will repair a portable AC unit. So we have this POS sitting in our garage waiting to get recycled…",1
I was expecting like the picture said it is cool air. And i put two freeze ice bags plus ice cubes and cool water and i only received ifresh air like regular fan,1
"Not only did it not blow any air out, it starts loudly shocking itself & filled my apartment with an awful burning plastic smell. Dont waste your $$$",1
A box fan could cool the average room down better than this junk. Don't bother buying and get something that doesn't use ice packs. Returning this immediately,1
You are better off just getting a regular fan or a regular air conditioner this does not blow really cold air.,1
"When I first turned it on, the fan was very noisy and obviously catching internally. So, I spent about 30 minutes dismantling the plastic to find that the anchors for the fan motor housing are about 1-2 mm to long. (Very bad dedign.) Shaved them down with a Dremel and now it works as intended. This Chinese product has a poorly designed fan and fan housing. If you don't mind a little project, then this is perfect. I would have returned, but it took over a week to get it in the first place. I have buyers remorse, but you get what you pay for.",1
This is in no way an air cooling machine. It is just a fan. Don't be deceived. The air is the same temperature no matter if the ice packs are in the machine or not. Waste of money.,1
This item doesn't perform as advertised. It's no more powerful than a common $30 table fan AND it cost ME an additional $75.00 to return it by UPS from Toronto to Guelph facility.!!! Not impressed...,1
"The cooler was no better than a cooling fan, Even with the ice packs, it was no better than a cooling fan.My room was only 120 sq ft and even after running the cooler for a couple of hours, the room was not cool.",1
I thought this would do a better job. I was really disappointed here but it just wasn't what I needed which was an AC so I replaced this with the AC,1
We were very disappointed in this item.,1
"Ordered the biggest one available. Received it and was broken. (Shipping damage) Received my second one and the media pads aren’t getting fully wet, which doesn’t cool the air correctly. Contacted hessair and they said it was a pump. To do x,y, and z to get a replacement. I didn’t have time for all that, so I buy a bigger pump than original, install, and doing same exact thing. Had to be a block at the top. Now I have a choice, return and try a third or pull apart on my very busy (hot) day and see what’s going on. Not worth the $1300.",1
"The media could not be loaded. This was bought to cool a space of about 550 square feet during the summer heat in Kansas. We got it and did a temporary install to try it out before officially putting a hole in the wall for the exhaust.The Set Up: the set up is pretty self-explanatory. When you take a look at the quick start guide that they provide. However, the drain tube was a little bit more complicated seeing as there are two drain ports, and only one drain tube provided. We initially installed the drain tube on the bottom port thinking that’s where it was supposed to go and eventually switched it to the middle port after we opened it up and realized there was water in the middle port. The instructions do not specify, if once installed in the middle port the bottom port needs to stay open or we need to get another hose. It just kind of doesn’t talk about it.The Unit: In the video we’ve had it on for about 45 minutes and the room is still quite hot. All windows and doors are closed there’s no air leaks anywhere. The unit itself is noisy but I’d be willing to overlook this if it actually cooled. There are brief moments when it will shoot out very cold air and then all of a sudden it’s like the fan is the only thing running. You can even hear a change in the way it sounds when the compressor is working and when it’s only the fan. Honestly based on reviews I expected the unit to cool quickly or at least cool the space instead of circulating the air.The Remote: five of the buttons on the remote are not available for the model that I purchased. The guide says to push turbo button to turn on a faster mode, more powerful mode and honestly it does not make a difference.Overall for the price and the unit as it’s advertised, I would not recommend it does not cool, which is literally the reason that it was purchased it’s been running now for about an hour as I’m finishing this review and the room has yet to even begin cooling down at all. Essentially we just purchased a very expensive fan. Will be returning this product.",1
"Update: This is a very poorly designed AC model. I have had the unit for a month now and I wish I had of bought a window unit. So not only is it noisier then my last window AC unit, there is this knocking sound that sounds like something it loose. I tried to use to the remote a week later and it wouldn't work. I tried to turn it on and off and a bunch of other functions. Nadda. I emailed the manufacturer about the remote and let them know and they said only a few options actually work on the remote control... Not sure why they would have buttons on the remote if they don't do anything...The biggest issues I have found with the unit it the water. It comes with a hose that could be put out the windows if its close enough to it. I had to use a bucket as the hose was too short. But the hose is at the top of the water collection so it essentially dose nothing. A few drops came out. The unit shut off and said that it was full of water but the drain plug is all the way at the bottom of the unit.... No removable container. No room to get anything under it to drain it. You either have to be super strong to be able to life it into the tub or roll it outside to drain the water out.... Its very hard to move around with the extra weight of the water even though its on wheels... I wish I had of done more research before buying this unit.It is noisier then my old window unit. The window kit does not fit any of my windows so I to improvise and use some tape. All the window kits pieces were the same size. Should come with a couple smaller pieces to be able to fit all window sizes. Its actually only 5000BTU not 8000BTU. It throws out a lot of heat from the back which is where the air intake is. It does cool but I wish I had of gotten a 5000BTU window AC unit for a fraction of the cost. Not worth the $400 in my opinion.",1
"As a senior I cannot return it now, too heavy and I live alone even after I asked them for a return.",1
"Purchased this unit for bedroom after reading several reviews that raved. I watched video on best method for set up and use; seemed easy enough. Started it up when warm weather kicked in; did nothing. Watched video again and did exactly as stated using ice packs that were included. Started up again with curtains closed, door closed walked into a sauna on a 75 degree night. This product does not work.",1
Do not buy. Worked for 6 months and nothing but a pain.,1
"I have had this unit for 2 weeks and it no longer blows cold air. Unit was installed properly, drain line is clear, filters are clean, not iced up, on cool mode and waited allotted time before turning unit on. It worked great for the first week and a half and now only blow hot air.",1
"I was actually very excited about getting this product as i wanted to be able to use it outdoors in the evenings to cool the patio and/or the garage if I am working out there. It gets extremely hot in AZ where 100 - 117 degrees is common during the summer. I used ICE and the frozen blocks with the water but it blows cold for only a short time and then it blow warm air when its set for cool air. The fan also is not very strong as you can barely feel the breeze when you are sitting only 4-6 feet away, so a very weak fan.I will be returning this product back and hopefully get a full refund.",1
"Product was purchased as a gift. The unit was just recently opened, past the amazon return policy date. The unit does not turn on, light up or make any kind of indication that it is a functioning unit. It seems to be defective, but cannot return through amazon. Very disappointed in this purchase, as I should have opened and checked before gifting. I just assumed that it would work considering reviews and the price. Hoping seller can issue a refund or replacement.",1
"It’s very portable due to the light weight when empty, the pump and design works nice, however after a year of use, the medium and low fan stopped working. I’ve always left it on high but the medium nor low work now. Since idk when but it just shuts off the fan. But the high has a nice breeze to it. Overall worth it for my use. UPDATE: Now the high setting no longer works so therefore the entire thing is useless now. Lasted a little over a year but not worth it.",1
"Extremely disappointment with this Portable AC NPLD3-06C/X1E AKA CF1 that I recently purchased from Amazon. This product is, without a doubt, the worst of the worst in terms of misrepresented products sold on Amazon.I purchased a 10,000 BTU 450 sq ft unit, but the unit I received is only 6000 BTU and does not cover 450 sqft or even the 350 sqft it says on the box. The part number listed on the unit says 150 to 300 sq ft max coverage. On other listingd. This product has three different part numbers and three different listed manufacturers associated and included with the unit. information, including Acekool, Creative Inovations Inc, CFI, and a myriad of incorrect and unverifiable information.The unit also short cycles off and on every 3 to 5 minutes, and the user manual is filled with discrepancies and typos. This is clearly a very poor sub-standard Chinese knockoff. I found 24 different manufacturers online that use this same part number. This is obviously whiteboxed by a company and sold to anyone wanting to buy a few and slap their branding on them.I am extremely disappointed with this product and will be returning it immediately.",1
"This thing is ineffective. The exhaust air that flows through the exit duct heats up behind the unit, competing with the cool air in front. So, the temperature in my 150-square-foot room never drops below 80 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. Humidity is still over 69% throughout the day.Furthermore, we will always be concerned about the water overflowing and window adapter detaching from the window when the unit is moved slightly. The window adapter is useless and had to use duct tape to keep it from falling down. The widow adapter also does not keep heat out and will leak with the heat coming from the air duct.This device also takes up a lot of space with a bucket for collecting the water. Instead, I bought an AC window unit from LG, which is much more efficient and takes up no space; the entire room is cooled below 60 degrees Fahrenheit in less than two hours. Never again I will purchase a portable air conditioner.",1
"It works like a regular fan, its not could at allWaist of money",1
"A real pity this didn't work. We bought this months ago in preparation for an extended camping trip. My bad for not testing it ahead of time. When we went to use it, an E1 error is the only thing it'd display and would only run the fan. E1 = malfunctioning ambient temp sensor which can't be repaired.",1
The product arrived undamaged. It doesn't cool at all. You'd be better off with a fan.,1
"After a horrible first delivery with a severely damaged and opened box that was missing the manual and remote, I sent it back and received another one.After setting it all up, I noticed that it makes a loud moaning sound in heat or cool mode. Worse, it cycles on and off so that you can't even try to get used to it!It was so loud when I tried to sleep with it on that my wife and I turned it off. This unit is in the bedroom. You can hear the loud moaning with the bathroom door shut. You can hear it all the way out in the kitchen.If you can't sleep with it, you can't keep it. We have already Been through a lot returning the first one I will run this for a day or two to see if we can get used to it before our ears give out, or if it quiets down.Super disappointed so far. GE used to be a name that meant something. Apparently not today. Newer technology should mean a new one would be much quieter than ones I have owned in the past. Nope!UPDATE:I returned it, and bought a much less expensive and much quiter Black and Decker 14,000 btu model. Satisfied so far, still waiting for my close to 700 dollar refund from Amazon for the horrible GE branded a/c.",1
"Horrible service and finger pointing. Never delivered after 1 month, and both GE and Amazon wont give me a credit.",1
The compres sd or kept kicking on and off. I returned it.,1
The air conditioner literally worked two days then stopped working.,1
Quit oscillating after 12 months of use. I used as a fan only.,1
This AC unit is a nice size for a very small area. It does not cool off an entire room and it is a little louder than that I thought. It wasn’t expensive but you get what you pay for with this one.,1
"Opened one package 21 days after purchase. The units do not have a hose connection. It is not explained in the description that they have to manually fill the tanks. We are not able to do that. Requested a return authorization from the vendor on the 25th day. They never responded. We applied a request again and now the Vendor says they says they (4 units) are now not returnable. THIS IS NOT RIGHT! We will be appealing to Amazon to make the Vendor take these back, still new (only one opened) and none of them ever used.",1
"It worked great for a little bit, now it won't stop leaking all over my carpet.",1
Dislike the cost of the item that has hardly a few hours on it. Compressor runs a few minutes and then shuts off and on continuously.,1
"I have had this AC for a little over a year. In that time, I have only used it for around 6 months before it just stopped working on all functions. When I start it up, I only hear a whirring noise in the unit like it is trying to start but won't. I would advise going with a different brand of AC unit.",1
"It doesnt cool at all, very very disappointed, misleading advertising, total waste of my money, dont want this product, it works as a humidifier only want to return it but very big to ship back and i disposed of box when i opened it, very upset with the misleading advertising for cooling have no use for this product, want my money back, didnt want to give it any stars but had to to submit email",1
I purchased two of these because I wanted one for the bedroom and one for my art studio. unfortunately the second one I received was defective. It turns itself off after a while even when the timers aren't set and there is still water in it.I just wanted to exchange the defective air cooler with another one.What I Found out was they do not do exchanges...Plus... I would have to pay my own return shipping costs (large package) and... they take a 15% restock fee off of the refund.BE AWARE OF THEIR RETURN POLICIES BEFORE PURCHASING! I will not purchase another item from this company again.,1
"This cooler is extremely noisy! You can hear the water ""bubbling"" in the cooling section and the fan blows loudly. Additionally, there is an unpleasant smell. Definitely not want I wanted!!!",1
"I was excited that our new ac came two days ahead of schedule. Pretty easy to set up. Getting the vent tube installed was a pain, but that’s usually how they all are.Day 1 worked great. Cold air, good movement of air.Day 2 nothing, would not turn on at all. Tried a different outlet, reset the fuse, nothing helped.We live pretty far from stuff, returning this is going to be a pain :(",1
"First, this product does not cool; not even 1 degree difference. I monitored this; and it's not just a feeling. Then, the seller requires the buyer to pay the return shipping cost; which is over $100. Almost the cost of the item. They may advertise returns and guarantees, but the buyer has to incur the costs for them to honor their policy. I wish Amazon would not let these types of sellers to use their site. Amazon users are accustom to no cost returns, and I've had sellers send me return shipping labels to honor a return or warranty policy. Poor product and even poorer customer service, if that's possible.",1
"Very cheaply made! I was hopeful after removing it from it's box, was cool for about an hour. The pump lasted for about a week, had it been well made it would have been a great unit! Good design an excellent size, for moving to different areas. After the pump stopped working, the unit started leaking water from the seam in the middle of the unit. Not good for hard water areas. Totally clogged up pipeline, that the water runs through!",1
"The reviews are not accurate for the cooling aspect. Even with the ice packs, ice cubes, and cold water, it just acts as a fan. Very disappointed in this purchase.",1
"Had to give 1 star or can’t post the review. Not really 1 star should be “0”….This product is a complete waste of your money. I was attracted by the appearance and design, having use an outdoor evap cooler on my patio I was hoping this would be an upgrade. Complete waste of money after only 4 to 5 weeks the pump that sends water to the cooling pads on 3 sides of the unit quit pumping water which leave you with a very inefficient fan blowing hot air. Contacted the company and after they had me trouble shoot the problem by opening it up and video taping my removing examining the pump they then wanted me to wait for a part and for me to install it. When I refused and expressed my frustration they apologized and sent me a “new” unit. I received the new unit a few days later. Now about 2 weeks later it too no longer works because the pump stopped working. Don’t waste your time and money on this product. “New” one heading to the trash heap.",1
"I have two pairs of these (one for me and one for my housemate). They are precisely the same.First, the microphone is VERY loose. Like, you can knock it out of the socket with an aggressive whip of the head. Furthermore, don't bother trying to replace it, because I tried two others and they fit the same and didn't work and it's hard to fit a replacement since there is a small recess that most options don't fit into.Second, the sound quality is terrible. It's ""fine"" at moderate to low volume, if a little anemic. However, at anything approaching medium loud to loud, they distort heavily and are absolutely unlistenable. Any significant bass breaks up and crackles and it's clear continued use will blow out the drivers.Finally, you can't fit any aftermarket tips on these. Everything just pops off. So, don't bother trying to get foam tips or other better isolating solutions. They won't fit. Even if they fit on the buds, they will not hold and will stay in your ear when you remove the buds.Find a different solution. These are like 10x the cost they should be given the quality and other options out there.",1
I purchased the same set twice because they were comfortable and had good sound quality however the mics went bad very fast. I bought my last pit in April and the mic is already shot,1
"I'm not picky in life, but this headset is really not worth our money/time. They arrive on date (super quick by the way), but as soon as I opened up the package I knew it was a bad deal. First, the headset was super dirty, I had to clean them with alcool cause there was a dry/sticky brown substance all over the left pad. Then I realised that the 2 pad were not even at all. I have to use the headset off center and it look/feel super wrong.PSOh, I just noticed that the sound sometime suddently cuts for few seconds. Bonus.",1
"I recently purchased the Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro headphones for $300, expecting a premium experience given the hefty price tag. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.First and foremost, comfort is key when it comes to headphones, and I had high hopes that these would deliver. Sadly, they felt anything but comfortable. The ear cushions are stiff and don’t conform to the shape of my ears at all. After just a short period of use, I found myself constantly adjusting them and taking breaks, which defeats the purpose of having a high-end headset for long gaming or listening sessions.Additionally, the headband feels rigid and offers very little cushioning, leading to discomfort on the top of my head. I had expected a luxurious feel and fit, but instead, it feels like I’m wearing a cheap pair of headphones.For $300, I was anticipating a level of quality and comfort that this product simply does not deliver. I wish I could say the sound quality made up for it, but if I can’t wear them comfortably, it hardly matters. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere if you value comfort as much as sound quality.Overall, I regret this purchase and would not recommend the Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable audio experience. Save your money!",1
"It’s my second, the first I returned quickly cause have a problem with the mic, a bad noise, then send me another one that the first impression was it’s broken for one side, the cable it’s really sensitive, if you are using and move your body for anything start to stop the sound for one side.. good for hear music or nothing important.. just regular and cheap Headset..",1
"Razer is notorious for having terrible software issues so Synapse does not work. No bass, no lights, and the first time it fell on the floor one of the skinny PLASTIC hanger thing broke. Not impressed at all by the look either. I’ve had a set of The Nari Ultimates which lasted me for YEARS and has been dropped MANY times. Do not buy this, it is cheaply made and honestly not very comfortable. DO NOT BUY THIS.",1
"plugged in the microphone into both ports of my Astro A4, TR’s restarting my Xbox nothing worked. The mic does not work. doesn’t even give me a signal terrible product do not buy.",1
"The metal rod and the hole does not fit right out of the box. You must carefully force it down that hole. It is as if there is a missing wooden or plastic dao or insert piece that joins the rod into the inside of the hole in the base.Simple LED base works as advertised. When you light up the LED you can see on the bottom curve of the base there are two dark spots, and then two more dark spots again at the back .The wireless charger does work for tiny devices like your true wireless earbuds case, smartwatch, but there is no rubber it's all plastic making it very slippery.It will gingerly hold your 1 overear headphones but you may need to get rubber or silicone tape to keep it in place.",1
"There is no base or box, just USB cable, support rod, and the headphone cradle sent in a zip bag..Think how you would feel if you ordered the headphone stand and received this!I will update this review if I ever get sent what I ordered, a useable RGB headphone stand with a wireless charger!",1
"My brother was complaining that his headset microphone was starting to go out, so I offered to buy him a replacement if he found an Amazon listing. We double checked that this microphone was the correct microphone for his headset and placed an order.We were VERY disappointed to find that even though the microphone fits into the headset and is seemingly identical to the original microphone from his headset, it does NOT work.",1
it does not fit the product,1
Did not work as if it had of been the one in the photo it would have. Thanks for nothing. Not even worth my fuel to return. Got me good.,1
The code to activate the headset wasn’t included! I’m not going to wait for another one. I’m returning this one!!,1
"Decent sound, not much depth though. Plastic is super cheap and the headband let go after about 60 days or so of use. Wouldn't recommend this thing to anybody as a result. Threw it out and got a HyperX Cloud Alpha S instead.",1
Didn't work for turtle beaches...,1
"I purchased two of these. One for myself and one for my boyfriend. His only lasted two weeks. They are made of very cheap plastic and the ear piece broke right off during light use. Both of ours have had recurring mic issues related to compatibility issues with Windows 11. The mic randomly gets super boosted and activates even when there is no speaking going on. It is extremely loud and painful to anyone listening to the conversation. We found two ways of resolving this. One was to download their update platform and force an update even if there is none. This took a lot of time and only resolves the issue for a few hours. The other solution was to simply unplug the USB and plug it back in, but this only ever worked half the time and also only resolved the issue for a few hours.THIS THING IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Technical issues aside, the sound quality is not that great. I ended up replacing his with a cheap $30 headset that works far better and has no issues whatsoever. Steer clear of this abomination!",1
"Purchased this to replace my gen 1 Astro A50 that I've used for years and the batteries have recently finally stopped working. The headband is larger which is why I bought this. However, there is always connection issues or glitches with this. When I take it off the charging dock and hold down the power button. It'll either say: ""Headset connection"", ""Headset Disconnected"", ""Headset powered on"", or a combination of these. Sometimes It'll connect on the first try but most of the time, it'll require me to hold down the button twice to try and turn it on. There's also been a few times that it wouldn't connect and I then realize that the dongle is flashing red. At which point I would have to take out then plug back in the dongle.Recently, the microphone has also been having issues with audio detection or for some reason the people that I talk to could barely hear me.I never had these issues with my Astros but their new A50X headband are smaller than the original so I can't go back to those...I do not expect these issues with a headset that is this expensive.-----Update:The microphone has now started to sound like I'm talking from the other side of the room. I can't tell if this is a lemon or if it's the normal quality of this headset.",1
Does not match the description and pictures,1
0 STARS. DO NOT BUY. RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX THE SPEAKERS WORK BUT THE MIC DOESNT. THEN I GOT THE MIC WORKING THEN THE SPEAKERS DIDNT WORK,1
plugged it in USB and didnt work i check all the usb drivers and still dont work,1
"These do not connect to Xbox X. Yes the video shows you how to “connect” them but with components that are not included in the box when you purchase these headsets. Just spend a few extra dollars and buy the actual Xbox headphones, it’s not worth the time or trouble you’ll waste on these.",1
"the weight is too much, like too much, 490 grams, like am i holding another head on top of my head?, everyone complements the fetures but the weight, even for my big head it's bad",1
"PLEASE READ EDIT AT THE END.Do not purchase from this seller. Multiple issues with this item. Though the box came damaged, I was still hopeful. Upon opening it was apparent the box had been not only opened, but the item used. It is advertised as new, not used. The LED bar meant to signal battery percentage and charging status was broken upon receiving. The charging station also does a very poor job of charging and causes issues with the port on the controller. After over 18 hours of charging the controller wasn’t even charged to 50%. The only aspects of this product that works as advertised are the light at the base of the charging tower and the hanging stand for the headset. Very disappointing purchase.EDIT:After my review was accepted and submitted, the seller reached out apologizing and offered a full refund or free replacement as a solution. Their customer service was excellent, very fast responses and friendly. I received my refund in less than 24 hours. I would consider purchasing from this seller in the future and I do recommend purchasing from them. My issues are resolved!",1
I bought several in different colors. My husband and kids loved these so much I bought myself a pair. I guess I got the defective one. The first five pairs were great. I didn't open them right away and was past the return window at first use. They make an awful sound that overrides everything. Listening to music or watching a video or anything that you want to hear is awful. I am thoroughly disappointed. I tried to ignore the awful noise but it is over everything I'd like to hear. I am giving one star because they are pink and make a nice paperweight.,1
"Build quality is shoddy. The upright doesn't firmly sit into the base. A few days of not subtle RGB and you need to replace the the 3 AAA batteries as it flashes annoyingly and the power switch doesn't work so you cannot turn it off. I binned it. It is still flashing. A waste of money. I don't really need a headphone stand, but after this, if I do, I will buy Razer or Logitech.",1
It looks reallyyyyyy cheap,1
"On the 3D front, I don't know what I expected for such an inexpensive device that has no head tracking, but I was still disappointed by the Dolby Atmos demos: ""You can tell where the sound is with pinpoint accuracy!"" Um, no, it still sounds like it's in my head; I can barely tell the difference between this and the stereo headphones of yesteryear.That's disappointing but not a deal breaker at that price. But the microphone not working is a real problem.The microphone wouldn't pick up my voice with any real volume on my Windows 11 Samsung laptop (I'd shout and the test would say my volume was at 4%), and yes I tried all the usual troubleshooting steps, made sure the mute mic button was off, made sure the sound gain was at max in the settings menu, etc.",1
"I had purchased this xbox 360 with what was at first supposed to be a 250 gig hard drive. Then I noticed the add says 120 or whatever it is.. I didn't even receive 100 gigs. There is only liek 13 gigs worth of space and nothing except my profile was on it! The audio does not function thru an hdmi. Ok no biggy they gave me the RCA cables. I didn't receive a backing for my controller ""the thing that holds the batteries in"". Very disappointing and I would not recommend doing buisness with this company ever. Pretty much sold me a $20. Console.. shame",1
The first one I got from this company had the red ring of death and the disc tray wouldnt open. I returned and they sent me a replacement. Surprise the disc tray on the replacement one also doesnt open. What a joke this company must be.,1
I was hopeful in spite of a lot of negative reviews. The console powered up fin but wouldn’t connect to the controller. I even brought out my original controller from my white xbox360 and it wouldn’t connect either.Just a waste of time.,1
This machine freezes and requires multiple reboots will be returning. I can’t believe I was sold this machine knowing it does not work. Will not buy from seller again.,1
"I got one of these for $40 at a pawnshop. Spent about $30 on fixing it up and now it’s like new. Little bit of scratches but for less than $100 it’s worth it to play a 360 well I don’t play it, it sits next to the original Xbox in all don’t let these people fool you charging you more than what it originally cost back in 2004",1
"Xbox 360 #1 (Returned) - The controller that came with the Xbox didn't work making me think that it was never actually tested. We tried every hack online, including buying the cable to make it work to no avail. Please test your products... we've wasted so much time trying to get it to work.The disc drive was not in good condition either. I get refurbished, but this was like hit the side of the TV to get it to work refurbished.Xbox 360 #2 (Returned) - Error code E64, red light of death, random freezing, random crashing.",1
"I've bought this 360 as a backup to my original I've owned for the better part of 15 years, especially in light of the looming shutdown of XBLA. On the outside the console looks excellently maintained and well kept, however booting up the console the system loads into the OS version from 2011. This on the surface was not an issue, however the system would not update from the internet nor accept either of my XBL accounts for console or PC. This is not an unheard of issue and so I burned the updates from 2019 onto a disc and copied them onto a hard drive if the former did not work. The console would begin the updates from the flash drive only to still give the same response as downloading from the internet. After perusing forums and trying multiple ways for two days after work, the general support issue I've found is that this is a common problem with improperly formatted or set up replacement parts. I may not be able to confirm this due to me not wanting to damage the console but the system cannot even play Dragon Age Origins or create a new profile without demanding an update that crashes it or forces you back to the dashboard. This is not a 360 Slim issue, as my other 360 is an identical model save for some stickers and minor finish blemishes from more than a decade of taking the console to friend's houses. Moreover it also started effectively with the same version of the OS. If you want an Xbox 360 I'd implore you to look for one at your local video game store which unless I can repair this one is likely where I'll be trading it for a working one, unfortunately.",1

"After a few days more than a month, I have a chip in these not inexpensive placemats. I have had Pimpernel placemats for years and it was time for a new set, so I bought eight. In my mind, a one-month warranty indicates they don't have much faith in their product. I've only ever wiped them clean with a damp cloth and never dropped it or dropped something on it. I'm the only one using and, therefore, cleaning them and haven't have occasion to use all of them. I guess I'm old enough to expect quality products from companies that had the reputation for quality products and expecting them to stand behind what they sell. Silly me.",1
Not what I expected,1

"the design s may be pretty but the product itself is really a piece of plastic junk. They arrived in a nice flat padded envelope but as soon as I pulled one out and laid it downthe edges began to warp , won't lay flat. Slides around on the tabletop like the hunk of cheap plastic it is. I don't know what I'll do with them, they won't even make good pet food mats and it isn't worth the hassle of returning them.",1
"They are nice with color and the size but the texture is very thin and poor quality. I guess you get what you paid for. If you like thin then its a value for the money but if your looking for more sturdy and water resistant, you might want to keep shopping",1

"I have ordered 3 of these. The first one I ordered looked in very good condition, and worked well but stopped working after about a month, and due to a problem with my Amazon account I can no longer access it to make a return (have to use husband's account now). I then ordered 2 more, and when they came I realized that my 1st order hadn't even been the correct item! Only 1 of the 3 was actually a 2nd gen!!! These last 2 came in pretty bad physical condition. I bought it renewed in excellent condition, which should be close to new looking. Faaaaaar from it! I'm keeping the one that is actually the correct product, because (so far) it's working correctly. I'm putting a case over it, so the scratches all over won't be a big deal. What IS a big deal is the other one that came. Not only was it not a 2nd generation, as ordered, and it was extremely worn and scratched all over (even the keys had heavy wear) but it is even CRACKED on one corner, and the glass screen is popping out on that corner, too! This company is doing a terrible job, and I'm returning the worst of the last 2 as soon as I can. I'm hesitant to ask for a replacement because who knows what I'll receive this time. My expectations aren't as high as most. All I wanted was for them to be the correct item, not look like they've been thrown on concrete over and over, and work properly. Sadly, they can't even live up to this, despite selling these claiming they've been renewed to excellent.",1

"I originally had high hopes for this product at a decent price. Figured it would not be on par with a new one just in terms of it being refurbished but I still expected it to work. Now a couple months in (after the return trial is over) it's acting up so much it's completely useless. It toggles between different windows, pulls up new applications and skips around the screen all on its own. It's as if 6 children each have their own mouse and are all controlling my laptop at once. It was a waste of money. I wish I either invested in a new one or held off on buying a laptop all together. Don't make my mistake, avoid this vendor.",1
"I purchased a refurbished Thinkpad T480 from Microbeeglobal on Amazon, but unfortunately, the device was faulty and stopped working after only a few months of real use (less than 6 months). The charging port + Thunderbolt port were both dead (buying a new one plus motherboard soldering is not a DIY fix). I would not recommend buying from this seller, as my experience was less than satisfactory. Upon receiving my device, it looked clean with no scratches, but some parts and folds had dust. The internal (main) battery was not reliable since day one, but the extended one worked fine (48WH one). When I contacted the support team, they confirmed that it was a motherboard issue and that it was hard to fix by myself. I am past Amazon’s 90-day return window, and the seller’s support team suggested returning or replacing the device but stopped answering afterwards. Although the support team was friendly, it was difficult to get my message through, and some of the emails had Chinese words. I later found out that the team works from UAE",1

I need an account there too.If your life is way too simple and you want to make it extremely complicated to write ""The cat sat on the mat"" and store that, and call if back up later --- this is the machine you want.It comes able to do nothing.All the software must be download.All the software is designed to grab money from you by selling you this account and then that account.Can't make a note, and get it back without going through many complicated steps.And putting in lots of secret numbers.And establishing accounts, with the money grabbers who want to send you a bill every month.All they want is all your money, all your data, and all your time.If those are things you want to get rid of and have less of, than this machine will take them off of you.I do not know that the machine can do any other thing than what it tried to do to me.If you are a circuit board engineer or a software programmer, there could be something in the machine you could use. But not for over $100.My Aspire One bought 20 years ago runs WORD totally clean. I can write a file, store it, and get it back.",1

I purchase 2 of them for my son's birthday and 1 pf them is not turning on. Am all the way in Jamaica an they are asking me to return the item to get it replacement or refunded. How am I going to do it.,1
"***Update: I amended this review from three stars to one star, because a couple of weeks after I posted this initial review, my computer simply stopped working. It will turn on, but I get a plain black screen. With all the other issues I was having, I simply decided this was not worth the hassle and returned it. I will also note that I didn't mention it in my initial review, but this whole process also included another purchase of the same item that was for some reason flagged as undeliverable during shipping, so I never received that one. It's just become a massive headache that's already worth more than $80 in my time and energy, so I opted to simply return the computer.The return process was easy at least, but I will not be buying refurbished electronics on Amazon again.I'm leaving my original review below for posterity.***I bought this computer advertised in ""like new"" condition for around $75. I wasn't expecting miracles, but there are a couple things I have an issue with enough to give a 3 star review. They're not a big enough deal to request a refund (again, $75 computer here...I feel like going through the process of requesting a return/replacement is more of hassle), but not great. If this had been advertised for its actual condition, I still might have bought it, but I'd be giving it a much better rating.Biggest one is that in my ""like new"" computer, the track pad is wonky. It sometimes catches clicked down in a way I can feel if I click too far to the bottom left, and I have yet to be able to successfully highlight anything because the drag is weird. Neither of these are a huge deal for the way I plan to use this computer (especially because the touch screen does work fine so worst case I just highlight by touch), but it's less than I expected based on the listing.The other is that my computer arrived dirty, which I wasn't surprised by as other reviewers have mentioned it, but it was kind of disappointing. I don't think it was anything particularly gross, but there was a goopy smear on one of the device's silver-colored hinges that was rather off-putting, along with a spray of dried droplets on the screen. Probably just grease or oil and the residue of cleaner, but let's just say I cleaned the whole thing thoroughly before I used it.Overall, though, I just needed a really cheap computer to get me through a couple weeks, and this fits the bill. It runs fine other than the trackpad issue, comes with a decent charger, set up easily, all that good stuff. Just, you know, be aware that you're definitely getting what you're paying for!",1
"When I opened up the Chromebook, a small piece of glass lodged in my thumb. All of the damage to the screen occurred before it was shipped.",1
"When it arrived, I thought by the paperwork provided and reviews that the laptop would be in great condition working. I wasn’t using it so much in the first month or so after receiving it, but once I wanted to start using it for work and school, I noticed the battery would not stay charged for longer than 5–10 minutes unless constantly plugged into the charger. Some applications were also lagging when I tried operating. I waited some time but then when the problem became really persistent especially since I needed to use a laptop on daily basis for my job and school, I started a request for the seller to help me with the issue. I get a response that it is over the 90 day refund/replacement time frame (it was 5 days over when I put the request in) and that basically they can’t help me. I started contacting Amazon and multiple representatives started an A-Z claim, even though it was past the 90 days, I was told that I would be helped with the issue since the seller was not responsive. After a month of calling customer service, and being told that they understand my frustration and my issue would be fixed (I would get a return/refund), I’m now being told that Amazon can’t help me either. I am still currently trying to get my issue resolved with Amazon, but I would save your time and money and not buy from this seller. Almost $400 down the drain for a laptop that doesn’t function how a refurbished laptop should (I didn’t even get to talking about the cosmetic damages sticker cover up). I would strongly recommend saving up for a brand new laptop somewhere else if you are able to, because this will cause you issues (not far) down the line.",1
"Like a previous review says, very bad wifi issues, constantly drops connection, especially if connected to 5ghz. At 2.4ghz connection you will get 1 mbps if you are lucky. Tried everything in terms of troubleshooting so it is definitely a hardware defect.",1
"The right hinge on our Lenovo started pulling up on the casing, which in a matter of weeks led to the screen breaking completely. All of this was bad, but since it happened after we'd only had it for six months, we should still be good, right? The Lenovo manufacture warranty covers hardware failure and defects during the first year, so surely this would count?After more than an hour on the phone with Lenovo tech support, unfortunately, the answer was essentially, ""nah, we're good, take care of it yourself."" Why, you might ask, would a manufacturer warranty not cover an issue with the hinge of the laptop destroying the laptop, after only extremely light use? The guy on the phone told me, ""Hardware doesn't count the outside of the laptop. We mean hardware like the motherboard. Only the INSIDE of the laptop is covered.""So, buyer beware. Personally I'll never buy another Lenovo product again. And I'll certainly never waste any time thinking their manufactures warranty is worth a damn.",1
"Purchased for daughter - who is a grad student - to replace a 5-year-old laptop that lived a good life. Dead out of the box, spent an hour on the phone with Lenovo tech support.",1
"I had a terrible experience with this product. The charging port is defective, and the laptop won't charge at all. It's incredibly frustrating to receive such a faulty item. Why would you send out defective products, wasting customers' time? I expected better quality and reliability.",1
"Several show stoppers here...On the Amazon description page, the product manufacture date was listed as 2023. When received, the DELL manufacture date stamped on the laptop is 2017. Shipping was slow but packaging was good. Just laptop and power supply in box in bubble wrap. Aside from manufacture date, laptop specs were as advertised, HOWEVER the show stopper are; The internal battery is completely dead and will not hold a charge. The DELL diagnostics show that a test run in 2022 warned of a insufficient powered battery. My tests show the batter completely dead and the BIOS doesn't even recognize it. Also, the USB-C port with which I intended to connect to my DELL docking station was also dead. The docking station works perfectly with my 2-year old Dell Latitude. When plugged-in via the USB-C port, the laptop speakers squeal and the system locks up. I've sent an email through Amazon marketplace, an email directly to the company, and an email through their website customer assistance page. No answer.",1
System is not good as much as I expected.Hanging and feeling lagging,1
"Keyboard is flimsy and falling apart already. SLOW after required updates. Backlight on keyboard and speakers no longer work unless plugged in. USB port just died. Barely had 4 months and ready to scrap. Save yourself the trouble, there's a reason it's the cheapest in the category....Pros: responsive touch screen, backlit keyboard, lightweight, portable, excellent battery life, inexpensive.Cons: not as quick as it could be (but for the price plenty fast), screen glare in light, top shell is aluminum but bottom shell is plastic. The model is from 2021, the one I got was manufactured May 2021.I primarily use this for travel and laying in bed, for those purposes it works great. Don't expect this to hold up to a more powerful laptop, but for browsing or for things like Netflix and YouTube, it's great.",1
"It completly ceased working and would no longer turn on after the first week. The Laptop top covering had a bubble after I opened & noticed this after recieving, then began to completly peel off more with everyday. I was excited by the price and thought thst I would be okay if this lasted less then 1 year but this wasn't the case and like I said lasted no longer then a full 5 days. WHAT A JOKE! One thing that I did not understand was that this type of computer holds not a lot of data. It is not the best for streaming, playing games, apps or storing old photos. It's for the easy stuff, maybe to do homework and some research. Just keep that in mind before you consider purchasing or products like this. Because I used it gently and it feel apart, PLUS BROKE DOWN 5 days after recieving, I DO NOT RECCOMEND TO ANYONE to purchase. PLEASE $AVE YOUR Ca$h for a better product. ***And most importantly Do Your Research AND READ THE REVIEWS!!***NOT HAPPY!",1
"The media could not be loaded. There are two models of this Chromebook - one with IPS display and one with TF display. Unfortunately, Amazon didn't mention this fact in product description. I bought the laptop without knowing that there are two models. I got the TF display version. The colour and viewing angles are at level of cheap displays from 20 years ago! Very disappointing.",1
I haven’t been able to fix it but right now is useless,1
"So far, just opened up and right away tried the touchscreen. Product specs said it was. It is not. Debating on returning after minutes or of the box.",1
"I ordered one and the entire two bottom rows of keys stuck, would click like there was sand under the keyboard, or wouldn’t pop back up so my sentence looked like this“Mmmmmmmmy nnnnew laptop Is unnnnnnnnusabbble”So I reached out to Amazon support who processed a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement was also unusable because the charging port would not hold the charger in it. So unless I wanted to sit there and hold the charger for 2 hours to charge it I had to return that one too. So I reached out to support again and processed that return.I ordered a third one hoping the third time would be the charm but alas, it was not. This one has a battery life of about 18 minutes from full charge until it’s dead. I understand these are refurbished but I have some major concerns about quality control at this point as it doesn’t seem like random bad luck that I’d get 3 laptops with major problems.Also adding that these are listed in excellent condition however there are also significant cosmetic issues as well. Scratches, deep dents, bent corners. Not something I’d look at and say “yeah this is in excellent condition”. I hope the seller takes more care in refurbishing these in the future because it feels like they are just out here taking in a computer, restoring it to factory settings and listing it for sale. No way they could do even a cursory check of these and not notice 20 sticky keys or the inability to charge a computer.This process has taken me about 3 weeks from placing my first order and has been a headache all around. I wouldn’t recommend these unless you are fully aware that you’ll need to dedicate time and money to making the computer you receive able to be used.",1
"The battery needed servicing. Had to have it plugged in or would shut off after 30min. When removing my information, restoring to factory settings, a folder with big question mark showed up. Talked with apple support who was unable to restore it to factory settings. Apple support booked me with a certified apple repair place (London Drugs) and they told me there is a problem with the hard drive too! I would not recommend this apple refurbished seller. I love apple products but sadly would not buy from this seller again. Faulty product the was supposed to be checked and in good/excellent condition. This was in poor condition.",1
The listing said excellent condition but the laptop I received was bent in every corner. Looks like someone who didn’t know what they were doing tried to refurbish it. I asked for a replacement and that one was broken and cracked. I know it’s used but this is very low quality all around and I’ll never buy electronic equipment here again. Can’t be trusted.,1
"I'm not a newbie, but this was too good to be true. A decent Chromebook at 10% off. Well, it worked for a week, now nothing. Dead. As in dead. Brick. I'm being offered a refund (instant Amazon credit, up to 2 weeks to original payment method....seriously? 2 weeks? It's 2024). My suggestion would be to avoid the headaches, and time wasted (Amazon suport, Lenovo support, troubleshooting, lost productivity) by finding a different brand. Don't be tempted by the price. This brand is not worth it. Don't say I didn't warn you...............UPDATE: a replacement is scheduled to arrive tomorrow, which is good on Amazon. We'll see if the original was a fluke brick and not a manufacturing flaw...",1
"The description is misleading and should change. These must be old surplus Chromebooks. We bought ours as a Christmas present for our child in December 2023. In the FamilyLink app, it shows up as ""Intel Kaby Lake U Chromebook."" That Intel processor that was discontinued in 2020. Looked at the sticker on the box, manufacturer date is March 2021.",1

"It's a waste of time and effort to buy this HP laptop, as I could never get thru OS setup1) OS won't load because it is not a licensed Win 10, but a bootleg OS2) touchscreen doesn't work, probably because OS isn't loaded3) the screen flashed off and on several times, glitching, during attempt to load OSIn addition, there are several major hiccups during attempted setup that indicate that the OS is a bad bootleg copy of Win 10 -- a non-licensed non-authentic Microsoft Windows OS.Nowhere is there any indication that the Win 10 OS is a licensed copy.this explains why it has so many problems. Bootlegged SW should not be sold as a genuine product.Shame, shame on the seller - PT ELECTRONIC TECH LLC - and on Amazon as well for allowing them to continue to market and sell this bootleg Windows 10 trash that doesn't load the fake Win 10 OS.",1
"1st unit bought from seller Chrome Source which was horrible. The mac arrived rattling around inside a medium sized Fedex box. Opened it to find the mac was just wrapped in single sheet of bubble wrap then tossed in the box. No fragile label or anything on the outside. Luckily the cosmetic appearance was still good. However, I tried to power on and battery was completely dead. Plugged it in, turned it on and had to wait about 2 hours for battery to fully charge to test it. Checked the battery life and found the ""Battery Service Recommended"" warning. It had a total of 749 cycle counts on the battery and 4049 mAh life remaining. Nowhere near the guaranteed 80% battery life or better on this unit. The unit was very dirty, hair and crumbs falling out of keyboard and every port including power port had dirt and lint built up in it. This is by far the worst ""renewed"" product I have ever bought. I immediately contacted seller, took them 2 days plus going through Amazon customer service to get a response offering to replace. I opted to just return it as I already purchased a second unit from Platinum Deals which showed up very clean, in like new cosmetic condition, packaged well in an aftermarket computer box, full charge on the battery that had 6100 mAh of battery life remaining well over 80%. The second unit I kept. Point is, be careful what seller you go through. I would absolutely buy from Platinum Deals again but will never purchase anything from Chrome Source again. I will be leaving a positive review on the second unit purchased from Platinum Deals.Update: For whatever reason I can only leave a single review even though I purchased 2 of these from 2 different sellers. I am leaving the negative star rating due to my first experience because I feel that is more important for others to see but hopefully my entire review will be read. As far as the 2nd unit purchased from Platinum Deals, I give it 5 stars in all categories.",1
I purchased this MacBook Air after several issues with Amazon and other laptops. It arrived quickly but worked for only one day. Tons of error notifications and indicated an update was needed to a completely new IOS and is about 6 updates behind . It never turned on again. I would think the seller would refurb and update to work in current time before shipping.Save your money and the hassleStill haven’t heard back from seller and only option is a refund that takes 5-7 days after they receive it back (despite my data being on the machine and the delete via Apple is throwing an error code).9/8 update: seller has responded. Asked for photos of a cosmetically perfect laptop to “send to their quality team” when they were told numerous times that it was a software issue. Escalated to Amazon several times and reported seller. Really cautioning against buying from them. I’ve had a laptop I couldn’t use for almost 2 weeks while they’ve held my money.,1
"The laptop looked really good cosmetic wise but once my daughter started high school and started using it after only about 4 days, the device got stuck in tablet mode. I immediately contacted amazon support and they tried getting me to change it through setting but the ""tablet mode"" they had me search for in systems WAS NOT THERE. Even on the task bar there is suppose to be something that switches the mode on or off but absolutely nothing!!!! I am truly disappointed in this because I am an international buyer and now i need to figure out how i will get the device back to the US so i can return it. I really hope other people have better luck with this than me but I don't think i even want back a device like this. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE and no one that i spoke to from the support team could have helped.",1
"I absolutely loved my first Chromebook, which I bought in 2018. Since it had been awhile, I didn't realize Chromebook wasn't a brand and now everyone has a Chromebook. Because I was so happy with my first one, I checked and Lenovo was the manufacturer. So I figured they got it right the first time. And they were highly rated, you know by the people paid to highly rate companies by the companies. And I had been doing research for a couple months! Boy was I wrong. Even if you get the same cellphone, you expect certain improvements, all things being equal. Someone explain to me how the NEWER laptop is worse than the OLDER laptop! I'm so disgusted, is it weren't for the fact that my old Chromebook had a cracked keyboard and wasn't getting updates, I would have returned it immediately. But I'm lazy and didn't feel like going through the whole process again. But very angry since this is something I'm stuck with for a few years. It's slow beyond belief. It's glitchy beyond belief. YouTube is constantly freezing and the circles keep going so that when you click on the one video you want the whole screen will refresh and down the rabbit hole you go because now you've clicked on something else and now you gotta go back. And if I have two games open, the second game to be open will forever have the task menu bar showing, but the picture isn't adjusted for that so it cuts off the graphics.Oh! Oh! And let's not even talk about the volume. I'd shout but you wouldn't hear it through the Chromebook. Pathetically low volume, but the thing I really didn't understand was that when plugged up, yes plugged, not even Bluetooth, the volume was the same pathetic level as it was on the laptop. Last I checked, we used speakers to get louder, but not with this bad boy. This was not the case with the first Chromebook. I used my old Chromebook as an entertainment system, all the time! Even without speakers it kicked butt, but now the new one- this one, is quieter WITH speakers than the old Chromebook was without!",1
The description is very inaccurate and I will be returning ASAP. I have a high schooler and middle schooler and they can not use a computer with 4gb and 32gb.,1
This is advertised to have 512GB of storage but only actually has 32GB. Very misleading. My son is super upset.,1
I didn't realize you can't make the screen larger on this HP laptop,1
"Says 128GB, But its only 64GB w/ and SD card (Which it does say 64GB+64GB) but the laptop has no SD Card Slot",1
This laptop quickly became defective and the seller refuses a refund,1
"1. The laptop and the battery got so hot that I could not touch. These are old laptops not covered under Lenovo warranty. The website description is incorrect on many points— came with windows 10, not original Lenovo packaging, and not under Lenovo warranty.",1
Would not recommend this seller (Chief Computers).Sold defective laptop.,1
"After having this laptop for just 3 months it started running into a slew of issues. The laptop is slow and unresponsive, tons of pop up ads despite turning off all notifications. Keyboard buttons stick and cause issues when typing. The battery life under little to no use lasts only 2-4hrs tops before needing to be recharged. This issue has happened to a friend as well as we bought these at the same time for work. There is no support past the return window so we are now out $260 each for half working laptops. I would steer clear of this model",1
laptop was slower than I expected and it has a poor manufacturing quality.On top of that it came as defective. Touchpad never worked and didn’t even have a touchpad driver.USB mouse connection was pretty flaky with longer response time.,1
"This seller is peddling garbage. Brand new laptop won’t turn on or take a charge less than 2 months after purchase. Hasn’t done anything aside from sit on my nights stand apart from the few times I’ve used it. I’ve owned quite a few laptops and never had one bite the dust this quickly, not even close. “Brand new” batteries don’t degrade that fast. Period. Seller says “sorry to hear it”. YOUVE BEEN WARNED.Update: Laptop is now completely trash. Certain keys began to sporadically stop working and now it won’t take a charge at all. Transactions like this are the reason I’ll never buy another computer or piece of tech from Amazon. People can just screw you and there’s no recourse. Awful transaction start to finish.Update: Purchased a Dell from Best Buy for about a hundred dollars more than I spent on this one. Two months of use and it works perfectly, plus I have the peace of mind knowing that because I purchased the extended protection I can take it in should any problems arise. I should’ve done this from the beginning and I recommend that anyone who reads this do the same.",1
"I have to send it back. I've changed this unit for two days straight! and it does not come on. I've spoken with a technician and was told this is a hardware problem. The charge light comes on for 2-3 seconds, then goes off. Since I received this unit, it has not worked at all. Please replace it or refund the money. I am not happy with this unit at all!",1
"I saw this item for sale used for a good price and I thought it might be useful as a travel laptop: functional, small, cheap enough that it wouldn't matter if it was broken, spilled on or left behind while traveling internationally. When the Chromebook arrived I checked that it had several years of updates available, and it did. However the Chromebook is too low quality to be any use for anything: the screen is low-res, washed out and awful. The keyboard is so bad it's impossible to type on: although none of the keys was broken, half of my keypresses (on any key) didn't register, and it felt like there was sand under the keys. The hardware is hopelessly under-powered for basic web browsing tasks like reading email: having even 2 or 3 tabs open slowed the machine to a crawl. And the laptop isn't particularly small or light. I pity any schoolchild who has to do homework on this, it's a terrible experience to use. I returned mine for a refund.",1
"Firstly, the chromebook I received has less ports than the images on the Amazon page. On the Amazon page each side of the chromebook has 1 x USB port and 1 x USB-C port, for a total of 4 ports. On the chrome book I received only one side has ports, for a total of 2 ports.Secondly, the keyboard was filthy. It didn't go through a basic cleaning process, so my first experience with the device was scrapping gunk off the keys. This wasn't even regular grey/brown finger keyboard gunk either, it was orangey-red. The only time I've seen gunk like this was when I drank too much wine in university and puked everywhere and it was somewhat dry the next morning. Pehaps that's even what happened to this chromebook.On a possibly related note to the filthy keyboard, the '8' key does not reliably work. It needs to be pressed very hard for the pressing of the key to register. It is possible other keys have this issue, I've only noticed the one so far.There is also a crack in the frame above the tracking pad. If everything else was okay, I wouldn't let this get to me, but a crack in the frame is more than the 'superficial' imperfections that were advertised.I would be returning this unit immediately, but I need a laptop in a couple days for work. It does seem like it would be a decent unit if it were new or atleast didn't have keyboard issues.What I received was clearly not what was advertised.",1
"I thought this was just the right PC for us. We don't need much, web browsing, some gaming, some MS Office work. Yesterday I saw that the laptop OS needed update so started it. Noticed it was taking some time so I just let it do its thing all day. Went to turn the laptop back on that evening, and got a flash from the monitor but nothing else. I knew it wasn't a power issue because the separate mouse (not included) was lit, indicating it was connected. Tried everything I could think of then went to HP website. HP tells me there's 15 days left on the warranty (""whew!"") and gave me repair options (phone, chat, local warranty provider [Best Buy]). I chose to go to Best Buy. They worked on the laptop for about 25 minutes, and while I can't tell exactly what was done, I do know it was a series of keystrokes and a flash drive. Geek Squad hands the laptop back to me and tells me it's a hardware issue and not worth the cost of repair. I take the laptop back home and get in a chat with technical support. They have me do what appears to be the same steps Geek Squad did. Then they tell me I need an empty flash drive to reset/reinstall the BIOS. Now I'm not really that tech savvy, but I know enough to tell the technician that all the steps that they have had me do I already had done by Geek Squad, their authorized repair center. Tech tells me that without doing that last step with the empty flash drive they cannot determine that it is truly a hardware issue (really??!) and that they won't be able to give me a repair/replacement if I don't take that last step.Sorry, HP, but you cannot convince me that the cost of a replacement laptop is worth more than the bad taste in my mouth, and my withering review (not only on Amazon, but to anyone who asks) of your inability to honor your very limited warranty. I can't imagine why you wouldn't send a replacement of a low-end laptop just to keep positive goodwill towards your customers. And it's why I strongly suggest anyone reading this review to search for a different unit.",1
"The laptop stopped working after 45 days. I sent it to DELL they would not repair it, stating that it's refurbished. The description states new and it wasn't. I spent $599.00 on a refurbished laptop without knowing it.Don't waste your time with ASURION either, they will only repair it as well.AMAZON is useless as well, stating they can't do anything because it is out of the return window. They know it was sold as new and still are of no assistance. Buy from a store, not this lying company or Amazon.",1
"Within 30 days, my screen was blank and the system needed extensive updates. Within 90 days the adapter is broken and their warranty is not covering it as they’re saying it’s damaged. I have another Dell laptop and several HP laptops and their adapters have lasted for years. Not sure what’s wrong with this device.",1
"Battery did not work from the moment it left the box,... I'm sure way before. Not exactly the sellers fault, but if they weren't making money hand over fist there would be more time taken to insure products are in working order before letting them be shipped out. They can just afford to get this, refund the money and never see or touch it again.",1
Battery is almost dead!!It doesn’t start up !!!!,1
"I purchased a Dell Latitude 7490 from OLIVE Computers on the Amazon Renewed store, and the experience was extremely disappointing. The laptop arrived with a range of defects: the left mouse button did not work, the back cover of the laptop was loose, and, to top it off, they did not include a USB-C charger, which is essential for this product.I decided to return it immediately due to these issues, but to my surprise, OLIVE Computers charged me a ridiculous 15% restocking fee! This is completely unjustified as the return was due to the defective condition of the laptop, not a change of mind. I have since filed an Amazon A-Z claim, as this is covered by the Amazon Renewed Guarantee.For anyone considering buying from OLIVE Computers, be cautious! Their poor quality control and unfair business practices make them a seller to avoid. Save yourself the headache and choose a more reliable vendor.Final Advice: Don’t fall victim to predatory companies like this. Read reviews and take action!",1
"""certified refurbished"" - yea, right. It's not. The battery can't hold a charge at all, and every time I turn it on I get a loud beep and an error message about how the battery's so degraded that it won't work. Amazon won't let me request a replacement, or do anything about it except tell me to send it back in for a refund and buy a new one - which of course is conveniently more expensive, because this has gone up in price $50 over the last two weeks. Would give zero stars if I could, for both the product itself and the ""customer service"" around refurbished products.",1
Disappointed because the laptop won't charge with the charger that was delivered.Not sure if the laptop is faulty or the charger!Unpleasant experience,1
"This was a purchase for my daughter, and she wanted to buy her own Chromebook with her own money. We found this one that was within the price range she was looking for. And even though it was refurbished I figured it would be okay since I was planning on buying the protection plan through asurion. When she received the laptop it worked for about 2 days without any issues. Then it started randomly rebooting on her in the middle of using it and would not turn back on. She plugged it in to charge thinking the battery was dead on multiple times, and it would only restart on like the 50th try. Then it would stop working, reboot and repeat again. I called asurion to make a claim. They told me due to the multiple issues they could not replace or fix the Chromebook and referred me back to Amazon for a replacement. Amazon told me they could not replace the item, they could only refund the money. So my frustration is that I purchased a protection plan that can't be honored, and also a device that can't be fixed. I'd be furious if I hadn't bought the protection plan and Amazon wouldn't have refunded the money.",1
I got this refurbished. I have had multiple problems since I got this. The keys are not working properly. The touch screen is not working. Then the battery is not staying charged. I work at a school and I purchased this so I could stop using my school district issued chrome book. It is sad for me to say that the school district issued chrome book is working better than this is. I also purchased a protection plan and they are refusing to fix this under the warranty. They are telling me that if I want them to fix it that I will need to pay for it and it will cost at least $400. I did not even spend $400 for the thing to begin with so I refuse to spend at least that amount to get it fixed. I have contacted the seller multiple times and have not heard back. The address they gave is a bogus address in Texas. Then I looked online and there is no phone number that I can find. I finally told them that if I do not hear back within a certain time frame that I am going to my bank to file a fraud complaint. Then file a complaint with consumer protection. I feel scammed out of my money.,1
The media could not be loaded. I bought this macbook thinking it would be good quality since it stated “excellent” for the condition it was in. I’ve bought other apple items that have been refurbished and they were like brand new. The key board and mouse pad did not work as shown in the video. The left corner look like it was dropped. There were multiple scratches on the bottom and then computer itself was disgusting with crap in it. I would never recommend this product. Do not buy!,1
"It's cheap and can maybe help a poor college student who doesn't have much money, but don't expect to do much else with this clunky, languid hunk of plastic - I have just got this thing as of a few hours ago and have all but on thing open (Chrome - which you MUST disable S-mode to use) and the words are lagging as I'm typing this review - which is unfortunate because this device also has some unresponsive keys so I'm having to return frequently and make sure that I haven't (actually the device, but I'll be generous and take the fault) misspelt anything. Don't even think about opening more than one tab; the device will start spinning and start asking you how to deal with unresponsive pages should you attempt to open even so much as *one* additional tab while you've got only one open. I have just attempted to test this while typing my review, and not only did it need to reload the page on a tab I already had open prior to this, attempting to return to this page after the frustration generated by trying to revisit a page I already had opened resulted in this page freezing and needing to reload before I could continue my review. This is because the thing uses eMMC storage, which I am now finding out is notoriously slow. Get this thing because you are poor and only need it for one thing, and pray that it can even do that one thing reasonably.EDITED AGAIN: It's almost comical how bad this thing is; the first few attempts I made at connecting it to the my network ended in failure, only for the 4th time to be successful. The device froze and became totally unresponsive and I was forced to turn it off and turn it back on (it was laboring under the burden of 3 tabs being open), at which point I had to turn it off and on AGAIN because it wasn't able to reboot after being restarted. It installed some updates (lol), and then proceeded to lose internet connectivity again, this time taking at least 6 attempts, manually, to get it to connect. Moreover, it does not display any icons on the taskbar, you have to hover the mouse icon over them in order to get their names to display in order to figure out what you're clicking on.I recently suggested that this thing should be used only for school purposes and nothing else, but after seeing what a craptastic job it did of facilitating MyMathLab, I'm halfway reconsidering even giving it commendations for scholastic or educational purposes; it took it 8 tries to finally display anything in MyMathLab, and that was WITH pop-ups enabled, on a browser recommended for use by MML.The mouse pad is also frequently unresponsive. Really, just don't get this awful contraption.",1
"I wanted to be very excited by this purchase. The laptop is beautiful and the system runs well. But, this product, inspected by professionals??? Was shipped to me unable to charge… I am going to do some of my own trouble shooting and if it goes smoothly I’ll report back with a better rating. I really want this to work out. It just seems like charging is such a basic function I don’t know how the hell it was the thing that was missed by these “experts”.Edit: Best Buy are the real hero’s here. Was able to get the problem diagnosed. Amazon wouldn’t even send me a replacement charger, even tho it was established the initial one was faulty. So much for a warranty.Over all good price- but you might spend a little more time and money covering for amazons “experts”",1
Bios is password protected and not provided. Contacted HP support and they have a policy not to assist with resetting bios passwords.,1
"I have only 4 months with this laptop, overall is OK but the problem is that the battery is charging but it doesn't hold the charge when the battery is off and now, I can only use it when is plug in.the whole idea of a laptop is that you can take it with you even in places where you don't have an outlet available. big ball drop. problems with quality or perhaps not the pest quality.",1
"Amazon, I sent a cogent and thoughtful review previously, supported by imagery, which you deemed to be in violation of your guidelines. I don't know what part of my message was or could have been in violation since my comments were factual and supported by imaging.1) The device was represented as ""new"" as supported by an image.2) The device screen ""floats"" plus or minus 5 degrees, which is plainly defective.3) The serial number of the device was marked out which is a deceptive practice calling into question the legitimacy of the Windows license.This is not the service I expect from Amazon or Amazon vendors.Regarding this PC, buyers; I suggest caviet emptor. I'll return the PC and if there are any issues I'll dispute the charge with my credit card company. Amazon, I suggest you have customer support contact me if you chose to mute this review, as plainly there is something deeply flawed with Amazon and the vendor.Everyone have a good day.",1
"I cannot emphasize enough how disappointed I am in this purchase. Four months have passed and the computer is dead - the boot drive cannot be found. The drive cannot be found!I will never, EVER be buying HP again, and I strongly advise anyone who buys this to do so with extreme caution, because 4 months is a pathetically short time for a device (that is treated with the utmost delicacy) to fail.update: I sent it back to HP because it was still under warranty, as it was only 4 months old. I finally got a message back claiming it was ""user induced"" ----- they laptop has never left the desk it was put on since I got it, it has no scratches or anything. Perfect condition, except it doesn't boot. So not only is their product complete garbage, but their warranty system is bogus. I cannot stress enough how you should not trust HP and their products.",1
3 months right after receiving the laptop battery started to die. after so many follow-ups they're claiming its not sold from them. how funny,1
"Bought two of these and had to return both. The first one arrived and had a defective wireless card and would not connect to a network, which is required to set up Win11 (no ethernet port on this laptop). So I returned it and purchased another one same day as I shipped the return because I could not wait 3 weeks for an exchange. The second one arrived 3 days later and I did manage to get it set up and it worked fine for a couple of days. Then it would no longer power on. Completely dead. Tried leaving it connected to charger overnight. Still dead next morning. So I returned that one as well. And bought an Acer instead (which works great!).Be careful to review the return policy. Amazon does clearly states the return policy, but buyer beware. Both of my purchases were from Amazon Marketplace sellers, marked with Amazon Prime and ""Shipped from Amazon"". Amazon will not refund computer purchases until after they receive the item back and have time to inspect the product. Then it takes 7 days to go back to your credit card. It is not like most Prime purchases where you get the refund almost immediately after UPS scans the return package.On my first return, it took 3 weeks. That was from Seller ""Snow Bell"" and I eventually got a full refund. Then the second return took another 3 weeks, so I was carrying $1200 on my credit card while having to purchase a third replacement elsewhere (another $700 on my credit card). And now I am fighting with Seller named ""AmazingDeal Arrived"" on the second return as they are trying to charge me a $231 ""restocking fee"" despite the fact the laptop was damaged/defective and the restocking fee is inapplicable. Very frustrating and basically had to put $2k on my credit card and carry $1200 for 3-6 weeks waiting for refunds.",1
Not sure if it's because it was refurbished but the chromebook just would turn on after 4 months. I took it to 2 Techs and they said they usually problems was not it so I need to pay more so they can go in and replace any parts...at this point it would cost me more to repair than it is to replace the whole thing..more money out of my pocket,1
"No lead or plug came no instructions some keys would not do what they were supposed to do, sorry but rubbish",1
"This is a nice laptop, very portable so I wanted to use it outdoors or for presentations. The battery was dead and was never able to hold a charge always displaying zero. This laptop is supposed to be refurbished and checked for defects before shipping. Why did they send me this laptop and just wasted my time and their shipping costs? I wonder.",1
"Bluetooth does not pair with Logitech mouse. No Touchscreen to enable, does not work. Nothing mentioned on site. Only Touchpad is operable, no good for Excel. Very displeased with his model. Only able to use Touchpad not mouse. Difficult to use.",1
"I knew when buying a renewed laptop it was going to have it's minor flaws. As amazon states in the description, ""excellent condition"" is as ""Excellent (Screen: no scratches. Body: no signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 12 inches away)."" and ""Fully Functional (exceeds 80% of original battery life, generic or OEM accessories and packaging provided).""This laptop came filthy with hair, dust, and other junk within the keyboard and on the screen. The charger also came in the same condition with noticeable stains on it as if it was never cleaned. Furthermore, the keyboard was making weird clicking noises when pressing down some of the keys (ex. the arrow keys, alt, or space bar). The top right corner of the keyboard cover was also warped as if some sort of liquid had been spilled on the laptop, also somewhat consistent with the key board noises. Finally the screen had a large 6-7 inch scratch noticeable from well over 12 inches away, as well as additional scratches near it as if a cat had walked across the screen a time or two.Overall the macbook and its physical parts were okay and working good, but the cosmetic condition was no where near as described. The laptop was returned for a refund.",1
"Keyboard keys are not matching, sometimes cursor could not functioning well. And battery life is short. Not happy about my purchase",1
"When I received this laptop it had the wrong battery installed in it, so it wouldn't stay on unless it was plugged in. After several weeks of back and forth with seller, I received a new (and correct) battery. Finally, the laptop worked as it should . . . for a minute. After about a month, it got to where it sometimes wouldn't power on. That went on for about a month and then it just wouldn't power on anymore. I took it to a reputable repair shop and they told me the motherboard was bad. Price to repair is about what I paid for the laptop to begin with. Clearly, this was a terrible purchase and a total waste of time, effort and money!",1
Bought this item from this company . From the day 1 started to shut off and on . Send it back to the company and they received few days ago . StillWaiting for my refund . Send them 2 message not 1 response from the seller . Beware of this company . Avoid at all cost !,1
"I bought this computer in “excellent” condition and the screen and body were scuffed and scratched, it was overheating when doing basic tasks, and worst of all, the charger would not stay plugged in, and the battery life on the computer was shot to hell. It was unusable. The seller was unreachable, I had to ask Amazon customer service to reach out to them for me. This seller is ridiculously difficult to deal with and it’s not worth the risk. It took me forever to return the computer for a refund but it finally worked. Never buying electronics from Amazon again.",1
"This computer has been nothing but problems since I bought it. I've had to factory reset it myself after receiving it because it won't stay logged in and the os tells me my password is incorrect even though I've written it down and copied it perfectly, then won't let me reset the password. Microsoft won't let you talk to a person and now requires you to pay to access their chat feature. I can't log in anywhere, bought their office 365 for this computer and am having to resort to google docs because the product key doesn't work and, like I said, I can't log into my account to try to fix it. I've never liked apple, but microsoft will NEVER get another penny out of me. This is the worst purchase I've ever made.",1
"I purchased a used MacBook Pro 15-inch, hoping for a reliable machine, but it was a huge disappointment. It worked fine for only two months before it started malfunctioning. First, the battery life became unpredictable, draining within a couple of hours. Then, the touchbar started flickering, and now it won’t even turn on. I expected more longevity, even from a used device, but it seems like I bought a lemon. I tried reaching out to the seller, but they were unhelpful, and now I’m stuck with an expensive paperweight. Would not recommend!",1
"Please do not buy a chrome book from them.. horrible condition, the screen does not turn on, scratches all over it. This is a scam i think these people are passing around the same damage chrome book nobody wants and keep returning. I pray amazon flagged them from selling this product. The chrome book should be a donation to goodwill instead of trying to sale it to anybody who would take it. The pawn shop would probably not take the reason they are scamming to sale it online to people when it should just go to goodwill for somebody 2yr old kid to play with it as a toy since it not even that functional at all i would not sale that book to dog its was horrible. No way anything on Amazon should be sold looking like that. I want my money back. Go donate blood if you looking for money instead of trying to bleed money out of people passing around the same damaged chrome book you know do not work and not functional at all.",1
I've got a few of these because I need backup a lot and some of the women I live with need these computers. They're being sold like they're resell quality but they're not. Some of them have the whole number line not working and some have a charging problem where they can't charge correctly.,1
"This one is going back! I needed an inexpensive Chromebook for a Ham Radio project and I like Dell so this seemed like a good deal. It is a low end Chromebook so I expected it to be slow and have low storage capacity. Both of those are true and I was willing to work around them. I normally steer clear of ""refurbished"" equipment unless I am very familiar with the seller but I took a chance on this one.What I didn't expect is that it would arrived damaged. Please look at the photos. At one point it had been dropped hard on the right rear corner so who knows what other internal damage still exists. (That's why I got the extended warranty.) It was shipped in bubble wrap in a plastic envelope so I don't know if the damage occurred during shipment or if it was sent that way. The box I sent it back it offers VASTLY more protection than the envelope the seller shipped it in.But it still worked so I was willing to live with it until I attempted to install some Android software from the Google Play Store. I can't! Seems this laptop is so out of date that it hasn't been eligible for updates since September 2021. As a result I cannot load anything from the play store and almost two years of security and system updates cannot be loaded. I didn't see anything in the description that warned about this so I am returning the laptop for a refund.The description reads ""This product is in ""Excellent condition"". The screen and body show no signs of cosmetic damage visible from 12 inches away."" Look at the photos: you can see that damage from 12 FEET away. And, naturally, I have to pay return postage which will be about half what I paid for it.Beware when you see a computer ""deal"" on Amazon that features a ""renewed"" product unless security and functionality is unimportant to you. This seller, ""Tech Magnet"" is now on my permanent ""NEVER AGAIN"" list of sellers on Amazon.",1
"I can say that you get that you get what you buy. Cheap mini laptop, but mine came with battery issues. Doesn't hold any charge and Chrome OS version is outdated",1
"When I received it I was given a charging brick that would NOT even plug into any outlet I had so I ended up using my iPad brick. It finally turned out but I instantly noticed battery issues the second it was at 15% or so and it would jump up to 40% randomly then back to 15% or even less or just a tiny bit more in the 20% range, after trying to even log into my iCloud account, the laptop would just be in an endless loading loop so I never managed to log into my iCloud account. In addition to all of this the laptop would randomly just shut off (more battery issues) which is when I just gave up on it completely since no matter if it was plugged in at all times, it would randomly drop to 0% and die on the spot with minutes long wait times to boot back up again, some other issues were in the keyboard, the “n” key would have to be pressed deep to type the letter or it wouldn’t budge at all, same thing for the spacebar. This purchase was a complete waste of time, even at the highest price of $440~ I basically just bought a useless piece of junk laptop that can not function at all.",1
"I bought the computer and it came the next day. On arrival it did not want to charge and when I looked at the battery health— it needed to service. Why they sent this computer out, I have no clue. Along with that, certain keys didn’t work and they were all sticky. I took a chance on buying this one from Amazon, and I was highly disappointed with the product. Take your money and spend it on another product since this seller does not properly take the time to evaluate what they put out.",1
"Well, it did arrive when they said it would.Took it out of the box, and it did have some life in the battery. OK, so far so good.Took the after-market charger out of the plastic wrap, and plugged it into the wall outlet. Plugged the other end into the Macbook Air...... hmmmm, the Macbook isnt charging. Tried another outlet, still not charging.OK, so now I tried the other Thunderbolt port, and it worked. There was also some case damage around the thunderbolt ports, So I wouldnt call it ""excellent condition"".And when you spend this kinda $$$, the ports better be working.So it got returned.",1
This computer doesn't work and we brought an extended warranty for it. They won't help unless the seller does.,1
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this laptop on May 30th 2024, it had some signs of use but I would say its normal for a refurbished product. The laptop worked fine until Sept 15th 2024 when it was not booting up. I tried a few things but the only sign was that Caps lock was flashing 6 times. When I decided to to see whats inside, I noticed that the Memory RAM is glued to the motherboard with silicon. I am still trying to figure out how to fix it but quality of the refurbished work is very bad, and definitely it seems that they just do minor repairs to re-sale those laptops without really solving the root cause of the problems. More updates to come..",1
The laptop arrives on Christmas Eve and after unbox it I charged it for hours and the screen never came on. I tried different ways to turn it on but the laptops is dead. I guess someone is going to be disappointed for Christmas. It's a shame that the Inspection Sheet in the box says that someone already inspected and tested and the item works fine but it looks like someone didn't do its job right. This was a refurbished item so I guess the lesson here is just spend a little more and buy new.,1
"I was deceived as the description and specs of this laptop says anto-glare, backlit keyboard. I opened my laptop today and the function key for the backlit kb is blank (see photo). No backlit icon on it. Tried other function keys to see if the keyboard lit up but to no avail.I ended up checking the support.hp.com site and typed in the SN to see specs. To my horror BACKLIT KEYBOARD is not listed as a specification of this laptop. I purchased the backlit keyboard specifically to use the laptop to work at times in a dark room at home at night.To return this item is very costly.Not a happy customer at all.",1
"I wouldn’t recommend purchasing these laptops. I know it’s advertised as being refurbished and in excellent condition, but the condition part is not true. I ordered one laptop, and most of the keys on the keyboard weren’t working properly. It’s not useful when you need to type and put in passwords. I replaced that laptop with a second one just like it, and experienced the same issue with the keyboard, plus the screen kept freezing. It’s not worth the money or the headache. I’d rather get a laptop brand new without the issues.",1
it was a great deal. My daughter needed it for school. the number 3 didnt work and now the screen wouldnt come on i have had to return this product and the replacement,1
"Please do not buy from this company! My first Macbook that was received was defective, as it would not charge despite using 5+ different charging methods (including the one I was given).

I trusted HP but, this shakes my faith in this company's reputation. I have gotten nowhere with getting help and that only adds to my frustration. They are capable of better products than what I'm experiencing. DISAPPOINTED.",1
The computer was shipped with a defective battery. Dell will not provide a new battery without me paying for it. So much for a warranty!! I wouldn't buy a refurbished computer from Dell.,1
"If I could give this tank zero stars, I would. The biggest mistake or misstep, whatever you want to call it, was buying a Chromebook with only 4Gb of RAM. The Ryzen 3, whatever specs it has, is completely throttled by the lousy RAM. By the time you finish waiting for a page to load (if you have more than 3 tabs open), you'll be ready to go live in a nursing home. I don't know if 8 Gb of RAM would have mitigated this issue, but good God is this thing slow.Don't buy it. There are far better options out there at this price point. There are only two positive things that can be said about this wheezing tank. The screen is nice, and it better be because about the only thing you'll be doing on this monstrosity is watching movies on Netflix or checking your email. Second, it really is built like a tank. Heavy and solid, so when you finally get tired of waiting for a tab to load and fling it across the room, it won't break, whether you want it to or not.Those users giving this barely usable hunk of metal 5 stars can't be using it to actually get anything done. Too many 5 star reviews for this awful Chromebook to be believable.Update: 3 tabs open and it takes nearly 15 seconds just to close a tab and another 10 seconds to open a new one. Powerwash barely helps. Using this thing feels like a punishment from God.",1
"I loved my first acer. Never had a problem until the screen died 5 years later. This new one lasted less than 2 months before it would lock up, bounce, shut off the keyboard and trackpad. Calling Acer support was a joke. They had me do all the things I had already tried and then a full factory reset. Just like before it lasted less than 24 hours. I rely on this for work - and am now losing productivity!",1
There is a flaw in this product because when it was being charged I touched the side and shorted out. The screen went dark and the charging light went out and stopped working.,1

"This was a complete FAILURE on Global Certified Authentic's part.When the product arrived at my door I was highly excited to open it and package it as a gift to my son who is an over the road driver.When I opened the product and inspected the unit I was disappointed to find the following:The casing had a deep scratch on the bottom of the unit. Multiple others all over the device.The charging port was completely useless. It looked as if there was a broken charger snapped off inside the port. The unit would not even turn on.Upon receiving the replacement unit and charging cable, the power supply did not have the proper wattage to charge the device.Again, disappointing 😞 .I contacted the company yet again concerning this issue. I was advised that they no longer had any chargers for the unit in stock and that a refund of only $15 would be provided. Would you please locate me an OEM Dell charger for this device for $15.Well, let me tell you something. The charger that was shipped with the only working unit on the first order which is what was needed for the second cost much more than the amount that was offered as a refund.The product description said excellent condition. These devices are to go through a rigorous refurbishment process to check them for faults to see what has to be replaced or repaired. Failure on Global Certified Authentic's part.Two orders and two failures. I will never recommend this company to anyone and will steer clear in the future.Amazon should delist them until they get there act together.",1
"The chromebook works just fine and the specs are the same or better than advertised, but it is very clearly not a 2021 model. It is actually a Dell 11.6"" Chromebook 11 3189 from 2018, and I have no idea why thy lied about it, I still would have bought it. I just wanted a cheap Chromebook to watch videos on, with and HDMI port, and that's what I got, but the deceit just really rubs me the wrong way. The condition of mine is pretty good but certainly not excellent. There is a small imperfection in the display, and the battery shows as 78% health. Both of which I would have expected to be fixed on a truly refurbished product. Additionally the laptop is no longer supported and will not receive updates from google any more, which is also pretty suspect considering its supposed to be 2021 model. Overall I got what I wanted, but I would recommend buying something different given the dishonesty of the description in terms of quality and the actual product.Update: The battery completely died within 3 weeks of purchase. I requested a replacement and they send me another one with 78% battery health out of the box, and it is a 2017!!! Even older than the last one.",1
"I bought this computer, needing it for school work, and was a cheap option for someone who didn’t have a big budget. It worked okay for about 4 months, had some issues such as the battery dying very fast and overheating a lot. Learned to live with it and only keep a few tabs open. Eventually, it stopped working, and wouldn’t let me do anything on the computer since the wifi wouldn’t enable. Took it to a repair place, turns out the motherboard was dying the whole time and didn’t have long left. Extremely upset that I spent 333 dollars on this product and Amazon won’t refund me or do anything at all since its about 1 month and a half past the return date. Which I understand, but obviously they need to have exceptions or make the return dates on these longer since they are CLAIMING that these are in “excellent condition” When they are on the brink of dying. Very unhappy that there has not been any problem solving on Amazon’s side. And if you buy one, if ANYTHING seems off immediately return the product because it will probably stop working justttt after the return date so they can short you a couple hundred of dollars! And what’s even better is that in order for them to fix my computer it would cost over 900 dollars…. When I payed over 300 dollars to get it in the first place. I would’ve been better off buying a brand new macbook then this crap :) Atleast it would have lasted me A LOT longer. It also came with a horrible covering on it that wasn’t even centered on the computer so I had to peel that off. I would like a refund or atleast half of my money back since this thing didn’t even last me half of a year. Waste of 300 dollars that goes to this stupid company.",1

"Difficult to initially set up: no on/off position indication on switch. No diagram to show which way to insert battery. Had to guess. Guessing did not help when initially not working.First one I ordered only worked for a few minutes. Did not work the next day.Button positions felt uncomfortable/unnatural. Seems like the left-click button (top front) was too high. I felt I had to bend my finger way back to use the scroll wheel - did not feel natural. The right-click button (left side) did not feel comfortable to press.Second one I ordered worked for a whole day. Easier set up. I just plugged in the USB adapter, started working. I got a little more comfortable using the buttons. But on the second day I used it, did not work. Was getting very warm. Put in new battery, worked for a few minutes, but got warm again. My guess is that something inside was shorting out the battery.I might have liked it had I used it for a couple of days. But it did not last that long.I do not recommend getting this.",1

Also, USB3 is not backwards compatible with previous USB, except when Satechi sells the converter?For fun, I tried it connecting these devices a to a PC type-C USB port and it caused an over-current condition and shut the port down.I am sending the original back to Amazon in exchange for this replacement, and I'm throwing the replacement in the trash and eating the $60 cost.Live and learn.* * *(This is typed on a Satechi Slim W1)Problem with inadequate de-bounce means lots of dupllicate characters.

Or is the keyboard adding them on itss own?Too bad because the kkeybooard iss very good ootherwise.Excellent mmaterials and quality feel.Apple layout with helpful labelling of alt/opt key for Windows part time usse.Stable feet are properly grippy.Backlight is excelllent. Note that the backlight adjustment keys are in the Apple standard location but do not inntegrate with the Apple keyboard driver. The backlight adjustment is handled internally in 4 appropriately spaced steps. BBut this also meanns that 'fn' kkey functionnality is not Apple compatible. These are minor compprommisses.Too bad about debounce nnot working properly. This is an literally an '80s PC problem!",1
This product is too good to be true especially for the price. Might have well as bought it on Temu because it doesn’t work. Not even when connected directly. I’ve had this product charging for 8 hours and still didn’t work. The main reason I bought this product was because of its portability and need travel size but that’s a waste of the product doesn’t work.,1
Quite literally one of the worst keyboard and touchpads I have ever used.I have a significant amount of disconnects even with fresh batteries. The keys feel horrible. The signal and angles are frustrating to accurize because if I am at a slightly poor angle: no signal. The biggest travesty is the touchpad. No way to disable touch to click and no way to invert scrolling (it scrolls opposite to a normal laptop touchpad). I cannot believe this has any good reviews and hope to deter anyone from buying one of these in the future.,1
"The keyboard keys are not the same as a Mac. Command + V gets you a checkmark, not a paste. Back to the drawing board to find a good ergonomic keyboard for my Macbook. This keyboard arrived quickly and was well packaged and so easy to hook up and was already charged! The keys are smooth but the best feature is the wrist rest. It is very soft. I do feel like the keyboard should be able to be adjusted higher. When you lift the tabs on the back to make the keyboard higher to give a better slant, the increase is minimal. The reason I am returning it is because the keyboard shortcuts on the Mac are not the same. The keyboard is really labeled for a PC but they added some additional stickers like it can do both but Command + V gets you nowhere. Total deal breaker.",1
This keyboard was terribly “loose” and felt like it would need to be babied to avoid breakage. It also had connectivity issues with my phone. I do not recommend it.,1
its delicate and breaks easily not durable otherwise very good but at the cost it did not last even 6 months,1
"Blue tooth not working, cannot be completely charged, asked for a refund",1
"It looks good- does a lot of things - but not what is important. One the keyboard is not lighted. Two - you have no way of knowing if it is Capt mode and have to type to find out - if you are using a secret wording - you do not know if something is capt or not It really is not half as good as they make it sound, I am going out to buy a different one today.",1
"This is the worst keyboard I've ever used. The build is flimsy and cheap. The key positions are obviously copied from other keyboards but without precise placement, so typo is very often. Not to mention the palm rest is lazily made. It doesn't even hold your left hand.The whole typing experience is just terrible.",1
"When I first got the keyboard, it was just what I wanted. I had stopped purchasing the Logitechs because of the butterfly key switches. I tried the Klim Chroma but the bluetooth connectivity was piss poor.Enter the K300.Mechanical - CheckGood connectivity - Check (More on this later)Lighted - CheckRechargeable - CheckThe one issue was that the left Ctrl key never worked properly. I had to jam it with force for it to register. Otherwise it was pretty good.A month in, it started having problems with sticky keys. I'd type a letter and it would go on forever. You could workaround this by turning off the keyboard and then turning it back on. This would work for a while and then the issue would come back. Well, over the last couple of months, it's become more and more frequent.The last straw with the keyboard started about two weeks ago. The Keyboard would go to sleep while I was using it! You'd see that the F3 would start blinking, meaning that the keyboard had lost connectivity and needed to be reconnected. The thing is, hitting the F3 key wouldn't restore connectivity. I had to literally punch the keyboard in order for it to register to reconnect. This would happen multiple times an hour. On top of that, the sticky key issue started occurring frequently too. I was done with this garbage.Thankfully, Logitech now offers exactly what I want. I hooked up my Corsair K55 while I waited for the Logitech MX Mechanical to arrive. I'm now typing this review from the Logitech. So far, so good.",1
Looks good but that’s it. The keys on the keyboard don’t work. You have to strike the keys multiple times before anything appears.,1
I only had this keyboard for about 2 months before it completely stopped working. The instructions on how to fix issues are for wired keyboards when this is Bluetooth. If it wasn't for this it would've gotten a good rating.,1
"I ordered this keyboard and mouse and it does not perform well. When typing, it misses keystrokes and then doubles keystrokes at other times. Also, the number lock doesn’t stay on. I will not own another Lenovo. Going back to Logitech",1
It is crap keyboard. Dont buy it. You get two out of every 10 letters you type.,1
"Don't buy this fountain unless you want water all over your desk. I turned the apump all the way down and it wouldn't pump the water...turned it up one more notch, still nothing...one more and it pours the water on the very edge of the bowl, causing it to pour out. Before you ask, yes, the surface it was on is level. I literally got out a level and checked. I also made sure that it was assembled correctly and the cord were coming out of the slot provided, which they were. So this should not be happening. I did end up putting two popsicle sticks stacked on top of each other under the one side just to get the water to land in the bowl evenly.Another thing to note is that it only came with enough rocks to cover half of the base.",1
"The item does not come with a power switch to turn it on or off as you'd like. To turn the fountain off you have to unplug it each time. The ""relaxing"" notes of the water hitting the rock you are supposed to be hearing is overpowered by the noise of the motor. In addition, the lighting is horrible. I purchased another fountain from Amazon for $50 with 14k reviews, that one is much much better than this for function. The only benefit this one gives is it looks a tad bit nicer to the eye.",1
"This fountain arrived today. At 3:15 PM, I opened box and was impressed with how it looked. I read instructions and put it together per instructions. It was great! However, after 10 minutes it quit. I thought it may be the outlet so tried 2 other outlets (disbelieving that it would quit after 10 minutes).I took it apart and put it back together again, per instructions. Nothing. Did it again. Nothing. So basically, I spent money for 10 minutes of AWW, 20 minutes of being perplexed and now angry that I will have to pack and go to UPS store to mail back.I took this picture at this angle to show it was plugged in!Note: I'd give zero stars if possible.",1
"UPDATE 2: I had to come back and lower my rating to 1 star. This is ridiculous. We've all seen the $9.99 table fountains at Walgreens that are cheaply made and don't seem to last. But at least they don't splatter all over. This fountain is no better and just as cheaply made. It's motor is exactly the same as a $10 fountain too. I am so sick of the splatters this fountain leaves all over my table every time I use this. I posted another picture to show you what happens after just three minutes of use. It's cheaply made and I would expect a LOT more paying 4 times the price. This is worth no more than $10, and had it been priced where it belongs, it would have gotten 3-4 stars. If you get what you pay for then this fountain is a scam.ORIGINAL REVIEW: (Update #1 is after this.) I hope to return and update this review to 5 stars. Beware buying “used” with only minor imperfections. The one I received had MAJOR imperfections making the fountain completely unusable. Ever. I’ve included pictures. Compared to the other reviewer pictures, you can see the drastic difference. Mine had the fountain top leaves installed way too close to the front edge where the water is supposed to spill off onto the base/rocks. Mine spills right onto the flared edge and splashes the water all over the table. Ironically, I purchased this fountain to replace another defective one I bought at the store, which splashed water everywhere but into the reservoir. It also had a defective bottom on the inside reservoir with a grainy finish that prevents the pump’s suction cups from adhering at all, even when moist. I used to be able to trust Good Condition to Like New, but lately everything is very poor condition to unusable, like this fountain. And I only saved a measily few dollars. Something like this one needs major repairs and resoldering to be usable, so it should be sold for 1/4 the price, honestly revealing its need to be fixed. I just reordered a new one and when I receive that I will update this review with its quality and performance.UPDATE: I received the new one just a few days later. This is brand new, not used from Amazon Warehouse. It is a little bit better, however the suction cups still do not stick properly to the bottom as the instructions require and explain how to do it. The bottom is too rough of a surface to stick, with or without wetting the suction cups. The instructions say to get rid of the vibration noises, to make sure the suction cups are adhered securely to the bottom of the reservoir. We can't, it won't stick. In addition, the hose attachment coming out of the fountain top that attaches to the pump is at an odd angle that won't let the pump sit flat, but pushes it up on one side. The hose should be straight down, perpendicular to the bottom of reservoir to control vibration, but it is not. It is at a 30 degree angle and not possible to bend/reposition. Therefore, our new fountain has a significant audible vibration sound that cannot be fixed, and can be annoying when you just want to hear the sweet sound of the running water. The fountain top leaves that pour into the rocks below (rocks not included,) are now mounted further back from the edge than the first one as my new image shows, but it is still mounted a bit too close to the edge, and after 20 minutes of use my table was significantly dotted with splashes of water all around the front and sides of the fountain extending out at least 3-4"", which annoys me. I'm going to see if my husband can unscrew the fountain top and reattach it properly, far enough away from the edge as is possible and rotated to sit all the way back near the edge opposite the lowest water leaf side. and out of the way of the pump cord - to avoid the splatters. It should not be a problem if we have a set of holes under the fountain top from the previous screwed placement. This should prevent splashing on my table, I think. If not, I will be contacting the company to complain about quality of craftsmanship not being consistent between buyers because images from other reviewers show a much better attached fountain top. Two purchases having the same problem should not happen.",1
"Stopped working after 2 uses and has USA plug, not an issue but not working is an issue. Will be applying for a refund.",1
"The water fountain was bit cheap looking but was ok as it worked well with the bamboo backdrop. It was a bit annoying that it cam with an international plug (US or UK not really sure)and i had to go get an Australian adaptor to use it. However , the worst was yet to come. the pump lasted two days before it stopped working. Now i have a showpiece. This is a really poor quality product",1
Water pump worked initially. After 3 days it just died!!!Tried turning on and off. Didn’t seem to make it work.,1
"It's absolutely a cheap product the water sound is not calming and if you put something underneath the water to change the sound of the water it splashe everywhere, it doesn't look like the picture that is shared on the page , right now that l want to return it even as a prime member they are charging me $8 . Not recommended at all",1
"I was so excited and happy to put it on my desk where all my books and all other important documents, took a bottle of water to fill up and the whole water leaked soaking my table and paper. It's ok to make it cheap but what kind of defective item is this!! The water reservoir has a hole.",1
Not a great size or quality,1
The waterfall is really cute. Unfortunately I didn't open right away. I took it to work for my desk and the water doesn't flow. It lights up but that's it. Disappointed,1
Unfortunately this indoor waterfall meditation fountain does NOT work! hoping to get a replacement via AMAZON PRIME,1
"Super cute but the motor died within a month. It requires quite a bit of upkeep with refilling the water - I watered the fountain when I watered the plants every other day or so. That went fine until we had a 3 day weekend when the fountain went dry and the pump died. Maybe not good office decor, better for someplace you go to daily.",1
This small fountain is cute but it began to leak a little over a month after purchase.,1
So cheap,1
"After a few weeks this weird jelly like blob developed around the base where the ball sits. I washed it off and it keeps coming back. The water does splash everywhere and if you don’t turn it to the highest setting the ball does not spin. The stone has discolored and faded, I’ve washed it and soaked in vinegar and water but it doesn’t come off. For the cost I would have hoped it lasted longer.",1
It's the first time I buy a water fountain that stops working after only a month of using it. Not worth it at all.,1
"Returned first for a refund instead of getting the refund was sent a replacement which again was a mess in the packaging, there is dirt and a sticky substance on the cord. I Will not use this, returning the second one as well",1
"Product has an overall low quality feel, light is very dim, difficult to see even in the dark and next to it, hard to tell if light is even on. Pump is louder than the sound of the water, and sounds like it is already struggling. Box came damaged, and as this was a gift it's always embarrassing to apologize for the condition of the gift when the person opens it. This was for my son and he said if I paid more than $5 for it I overpaid. So I back it went.",1
"This thing is a TOY, a horrible joke... It doesn't make a sound, and it's literally a very little toy. 🙄",1

The media could not be loaded. I like the size. But it’s not making any water sounds the pump is not pumping hard enough to bring the water up. So dissatisfied and disappointed.,1
Cheap. Flimsy. Tiny. Couldn't justify keeping it.,1
Item came in broken. Material is cheap plastic. Don't buy,1
Motor did not work on either fountain.,1
"I honestly don’t like writing bad reviews but I wanted to warn potential buyers. After having it less than a month, the fountain leaked everywhere and ruined my floor and dresser. When I noticed it, the pump was running on an empty fountain which caused it to burn out. Not sure what happened but if you choose to get this fountain, it needs to be monitored 24/7 unless you want a giant mess to clean up. It was not filled up too much or anything like that. I did notice what looked to be a crack repair line on it which could’ve been the source of the leak. I even tried a different pump and the same thing happened over the course of a few hours. I’m honestly very disappointed because I love the look of this fountain in my greenhouse cabinet.",1
"This fountain is VERY cheaply made. The pieces that stack on top of one another do not fit together well and mine has always leaked. The I tried putting support pieces, gluing, balancing, nothing has really worked and the top tips water out the wrong side and misses the bowl. The finish is cheap and has peeled off almost completely and I could easily peel it totally off if I tried. It doesn't really look that great either. It looks like rock from the picture but it just badly speckled. I added river rocks to mine, which helped with the look and sound of the fountain. It sort of sounds like a toilet flushing if you leave it as is. I would spend the extra couple of bucks and buy a better fountain.",1
"Bought this item on March 2nd and here it is April 29th and I noticed the bottom light quit working and the top light only has red, waterfall still works, I only turn it on for 2 hours a day, so tell me why the lights quit working? Beautiful product easy to put together but definitely not worth the price I paid just to have a red light and waterfall, I still used to to hear the sound of the water but Miss the color light show and there's no way of replacing the bulb, very disappointed",1
"I was so excited to receive this. It worked for six days the pump no longer pumps the water. I only used it three hours a night and was very careful and it still will not work. The lights and colors are very pretty, but I can’t say much for the rest of.",1
"It feels and looks cheap and you can hear the motor over the small, barely visible trickle of water.",1
Giant gross looking beige flies in the box all dead thankfully. So upset. What a terrible experience.,1
Pump didn't draw water up when I plugged it in. Waited a good while before taking it apart to realize the hose was not attached to the pump. I attached the hose and put it back together and it's working now. It's made of cheap plastic. At least the rocks were real. Also a switch would be nice rather than having to plug/unplug***6 1/2 week update. LED lights stopped working:)Would not recommend,1
This product didn’t last me a year. The lights went out and the motor quit working.,1
Both fountains didnt come with hoses,1
Looks like a piece of cheaply made junk. I work in a quiet office and thought a fountain would be a nice touch. The motor is so much louder than the water that it defeats the whole point. Super annoying and haven’t turned it on since the first day,1
To small and it make to much noise and can’t hear the waterfall,1
This started leaking right after my return window closed. I contacted seller to ask to make it right. They never replied!Poor servicePoor qualityNot happy at all!Leaks all over,1
"The glue is just smeared all over, You can see the glue smeared all over the bowl bottoms and glass. Its very cheap. The pump is weak and sometimes stops turning the marble. For the money it should be better.",1
"I only use this for less than a month and it quit working, but of course because I ordered it earlier than I used it. I missed the refund or exchanging it. This is not a good product!",1
"Beautiful colors, but poorly made, hard to assemble no instructions in the box or online. Keeps falling apart, and it gets vey hot once you turn it on.",1
"Poorly made, hard to assemble. A strong plastic smell. You can hardly see the lights and it gets vey hot once you turn it on.",1
"Not what I expected, very very small and not worth the money. The pump is noisy and can be heard from the second floor…Disappointing to say the least for the money paid",1
I paid 70 extra dollars for this as a Christmas present and the poor quality of the result is infuriating,1
It's terrible that water is not flowing nor working,1
Very pretty but not even the slightest hint of the sound of running water which was what I purchased a fountain for. Just got it and it’s going right back!,1
Even though it says for indoor use it isn't. It splashes water even on the lowest setting.,1
Cheaply made. The wheel is plastic helf up by a dot of glue that actually keeps on stopping because the water isnt enough to keep the wheel moving. Smaller than expected as well. Doesnt hold much water which means you'll have to refill it constantly if you keep it running,1
Broke so easy,1
"Had to return it because the pump is incredibly loud. I have a fish tank with a quieter pump. There's no sound of water at least not over the pump. It's not relaxing at all. I am so tired of companies manufacturing trash and just expecting us to be too lazy to return it. I'm not too lazy.There are some people saying you need to boil the rocks and stuff. Why are you sending me dirty rocks? I'm sorry I'm not taking that time. If you can't send me clean rocks, it's not on me to make sure they don't clog your trash pump. It's just gross! And it's certainly not in the instructions to watch them. It's just something some people have figured out that have a lot more time than I do.",1
Nice little desk fountain. Read reviews for other fountains and settled with this one. Well I guess there is no great desk fountain that is on the market.,1
"The fountain is really cute and works, but it splashes well outside the edge of the fountain. I put a 20 inch tray under it and still had a puddle six inches outside the edge of the tray. It would ruin my floor if I left it running.",1
Not sure if I received a defective one or if it just works this way but the water is barely even flowing down AND the fountain is soooo small. For the price I paid… not worth it at all. I’m not happy at all. I’m super upset :(,1
Broken after one year use....,1
The fountain itself is beautiful but it ONLY worked for a few days. I returned it and quickly received a replacement but I had the same issue as the first. I was very disappointed because it is really beautiful!,1
DONT GET THIS PRODUCT PLEASE!!!!!!VERY UNSAFE !!!!!,1
"This fountain was nice until it stopped working soon after receiving it. I notified the seller and he stated that the water pump was possibly defective. He mailed me a broken water pump, I informed him it was broken only to receive another water pump from the seller that was also broken. Both times the water pump was not packaged correctly and arrived broken. This is so very unacceptable. I am extremely disappointed with this product and the seller for not ensuring the water pump was packaged correctly. I will never order from this seller again.",1
I've bought this product a couple weeks ago and only used it like 5 times max. I always made sure the water was full and I went to plug it in and pump doesn't work.,1
"Hi there’s some issue with my item. There’s no power, no light, water doesn’t run, it seems like the motor or the cable has some issue. Please assist.",1
"The little crystal ball is missing so I don't have the full effect. Also, the instructions are almost useless. You'll just have to figure it out yourself how to put it together. Don't recommend this item.",1
"Not a fan of this fountain. The water pump didn't work that well, didn't give much water sounds. I threw it away because it was just taking up space.",1
"The first time I got this for myself it was so easy to assemble, came with all the pieces, looked great once done.Recently my mom got diagnosed with cancer, so I ordered it to bring it back to her in Canada. Once we got to Canada and i started assembling it, I realized the main connector piece that connects the light bulb to the body of the plug was missing. What results is that the water will still flow, but we can never tell when the thing is plugged in because the light isn't connected! So basically it is usable but not really.This is extremely disheartening especially since we don't live in Canada and fixing such a SMALL problem will take a VERY LONG TIME. It's so frustrating too because this was meant to be a gift for a cancer patient who actually takes the whole buddha idea very seriously, especially since now she has so little certainty in life and so much to be afraid of.Needless to say I'm EXTREMELY ANGRY with this company for missing that tiny little piece. If something can be done to fix my situation I'd be extremely grateful.",1
"its quieter than most, but its painted so the water wears the paint out. often clogging the suction from the water to the sprout. this item broken within 30 days of purchase as the suction pump stopped working. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT at all. what a scam.",1
The media could not be loaded. Gotta update the post due to the water fountain lacking motor support. The fountain is so beautiful and looks amazing. The water is a very soothing sound. On the other hand the motor couldn’t keep up and unfortunately stopped working after about two months. It used to have a very sturdy flow but started to drip slowly and eventually stopped working.,1
The product looks great but it has a small leak I don't recommend this product.,1
it was broken when I opened the box. :-(,1
This item has arrived however it has missing parts. I am returning it for a full refund,1
"The media could not be loaded. Product is very unstable, no way to secure the top of the fountain to the bowl. The barely fits on the three protrusions in the bowl. There is no way I would light a candle on top of this. Total waste of money I will never use.",1
"I was pretty thrilled when it came in and had it setup in my living room. The splashing from the water left a real sticky residue around the unit so I constantly had to clean it, and the ball would constantly need to get polished up due to hard water. Otherwise it just kinda stops spinning and sits there hahaha. Eventually I took it down and stored it for a few months till I found a new spot for it. When I wired it back up and started filling it, the thing started leaking hard out the bottom. So yeah it was pretty cool for a bit but I don't think I'm ever buying anything like this again hahaha.2/10",1
"Unfortunately, this fountain is good for very short period of time (1.5 months )",1
I just set up the waterfall and it looks so nice but it does not work. I bought for work so did not try until today. I work for a school. My window closed to return in aAugust 20 th so I am out of luck. Hopefully I just got a bad one,1
"This product easy to set up does not make a sound as water falling into the lower bowl, the pump sometimes makes a hissing sound, lol, that you have to jiggle to get working for any sound at all.Poor design all they had to do was make the height between bowels a little more to duplicate sounds of water moving. Do not buy this junk.....Pretty to look at, had to find something good to say.",1
"It worked great. Now, 4 days after the return window closed it’s LEAKING 😡🤬",1
"This fountain requires you to fill it up with water every single day. It also is extremely particular about the amount of water it needs. If you add too little you can hear the motor trying to suck up the water. If you add even a little too much the water shoots past the peddle and will land on the surface you’ve placed the fountain on. I’m disappointed with this purchase. Instead of it being peaceful, it’s requires maintenance every single day.",1
This was small. It has no sound of falling water etc. lights are cute...but without the water sound it is useless,1
Very small in size. You need to be more clear on the measurements. Like inches or centimeters. Bought as a Xmas gift. But won't be giving this as one.I thought I literally bought it from wish. Not Amazon.,1
Cheap,1
"This is a love/hate relationship. I love how it looked and worked the first time I used it... Everyone who was at my home that evening wanted one... BUT the next time I filled it, it began to leak. It leaked all over the wood floor, and ruined the parquet. :( The plug will NOT stay secure in the hole...it pops right out, and if it's in tight, it drips anyway. Maybe a cork would have worked better. TOTAL WASTE OF $!! ...unfortunately, it's unusable... But it was very cool and pretty at first. I never write reviews, but in this circumstance, I wanted to warn other people about this issue. Terrible design, poor quality...Seriously, they've got to know this doesn't work, so why don't they fix the problem?",1
"I SELDOM GIVE BAD REVIEWS AS Amazon is an excellent company! But the rubber plug won't fill hole, I have tried everyday to stop the leak and it leaks badly!!!! I have not see fog or mist yet, still working on setting it up for 5 days!NOT worth the expensive price! Stand is flimsy and I have a cat. But I will fill the hole with a plug and go from there!NOT a good product!!!! Way to much work to finally get it working, which I have not yet!!!!",1
My fountain stop working after 3 months in so mad it is for my bearded dragon to get water I don't have money to buy another.. only have 1 star because no other choice,1
"The media could not be loaded. I love the way it looks. I like the water sound. The only problem is that the sound of the pump motor is just as loud as the water trickling. It's rather annoying. Is this what others are calling 'a quiet motor'? If I have a bad motor, it would be nice to know. I like the fountain enough that I'm tempted to just buy another motor, but the thought of taking it apart and trying to install a new one makes me cringe.11/5/22 Update. I've had this in my office since the purchase for no other reason that I've not had the desire to bother with another motor. I have used it on and off since then. I've had to knock this down to a single star, though. The main reason is leaking. It's leaked a few times now. The leak split my $50 wood tray that I bought for the fountain. I can glue that, so it's not that big of a deal, but it's frustrating. See attached photo. You need a flashlight to look into the reservoir to be able to see at what level the water is at. There is no marker so you really don't know if you're at the right level or over the level. This just isn't worth the hassle. It looks great, but the functionality is subpar at best. I've decided to try a fountain that has a separate reservoir where I can simply lift the fountain off of the bowl when needed and can easily see the water level. This fountain is a single moulded piece with a tiny sliding door in the back that you can't even fit your entire hand into to reach the motor. I do not recommend this product, unfortunately.",1
"When I received the fountain, it had a leak. I bought stuff to fix the leak. It worked for a very short time and leaked again. It almost ruined my table. Thank God I knew mayonnaise would fix the water spot on my table. I threw it in the garbage because that is exactly what it is, garbage",1
This is the second one of this exact fountain I have purchased. And the second one that has failed in record breaking time! This latest one I purchased in December . Here it is March and already it has stopped pumping water completely. I will not be repurchasing . Two in a row in less that 5 months have just clunked out . It is sooo pretty and peaceful when it works but unfortunately they don't work for long. Now it's simply an aesthetically pleasing rock with no water flow.,1
"JUNK I use this at the lowest water flow adjustment. Worked fine for the first few weeks. Then, as particles of light brown paint dissolved from the insides of the four ""bowls"" it began to plug up the ""sponge"" they had stuffed into the top outlet to lame attempt to control the POORLY DESIGNED water flow, everything changed! The 3 top cascades of water began to run down the walls of the bowls instead of falling into the little pools. End of cascading water. And since paint the has washed off, the overall appearance of the fountain is diminished. And no more pretty tiers of cascading water. Now I'm waiting for the dissolved paint particles to plug the pump, ending everything. I'm now past the return period, so I GUESS I'M STUCK WITH THIS PIECE OF EXPENSIVE JUNK.",1
"This is my 2nd Sunnydaze fountain. The first works great and doesn’t splash or dump water out. This particular fountain has a fatal design flaw - when the water level gets low through evaporation, the water cascading to the bottom level bounces back up and out of the fountain. After waking up multiple times to a soaking table and floor, I decided to try various water levels to isolate the problem.My findings - the bottom level where the LED’s are is concave in shape. When the water level is shallow enough to allow the water to pour onto the concave surface, it bounces upwards and out of the left side of the fountain. I placed a small rock in the bottom atop the LED’s to break up the water flow which did work for the low water level condition. Alternatively, when the fountain is full, there is a tremendous amount of splash out which also soaks the surrounding area.These flaws destroyed a piece of wood furniture and also damaged my wood floors.To top it off, the seller doesn’t accept returns.It’s a beautiful fountain but should only be used outdoors where water won’t cause damage.",1
"The media could not be loaded. turned out to be a major disappointment. It has design flaws, The biggest issue is the splashing—water ends up everywhere, making a mess around the fountain. It's not only annoying but also a hassle to clean up constantly.I wouldn't recommend this product. There are better options out there that don't create such a mess. I had to turn mine off because the noise was overwhelming too - Im sitting in the living room and it sounds like someone is pissing in a toilet. LOL -wouldn't recommend for indoor use unless you can make some modifications to reduce splashing and noiseMaybe outside porch would work better!",1
"I read the reviews and had high hopes for this fountain, but it fell way short of my expectations and I am returning it.At first, it was a bit loud, but I made sure to add water so that it covered the pump and it could still be heard over the running water, but was not as loud as it first was. Still, it's not something I would want running in my room at night because it was not whisper-quiet as the drinking fountain my cats have. I know that it is POSSIBLE to make an economical pump that isn't loud. The makers of this fountain might want to check in to that.I could deal with the loudness by placing it in the dining room or living room, but the final straw was that it LEAKED. The leak was somewhere in the base, because that's where the water was pooled. The sides were dry, so it wasn't leaking from the sides, but the bottom was soaked. There were no visible marks that it was leaking from, but after unplugging it and picking it up, water just seemed to seep out of some unseen source and drip from the bottom.I didn't expect too much from a 55 dollar fountain, but I wanted one that didn't leak and had a pump that was somewhat quiet. This did not live up to my expectations and is being returned.",1
This is not worth buying sadly. The ball does not roll at all like every other one of these I have bought?! We put these together all the time. The light on this one does not work either so it really is just worthless. Its very tiny too. I buy a new one every 3-4 mos due to the pumps on these do not last really long for like 40 to 50$ and this is worthless. Please refund me. Ill change my review at least.,1
"Not only is this water fountain a piece of junk, but it only worked for about a week and then the pump stopped working. The glass ball doesn't rotate and just sits there when the unit is plugged in. Don't waste your money on this cheap chinese made piece of junk!!!",1
doesn't work! the water simply doesn't flow. And that was after buying a US electrical plug. Not happy!,1
The item came defective. I wrote to the Seller who promised they would initiate a refund. Then they said that to initiate a refund they would arrange a pick up. They then said they cannot refund unless the pick up was processed. I did everything I can on my part and no pick up was arranged. It has been more than a month and the Seller has stopped replying to my queries. They kept telling me they would refund but not to write a review. I have no choice but to do so especially because I don't want others to also lose their money. Poor quality and poor workmanship.,1
This waterfall is driving me crazy. The water will stop flowing and I have to unplug and plug it back in. That will usually fix the problem but it's to the point that I have to do this 3-4 times a day. It's more of a hassle than anything. Definitely not worth the money and headache. Stay away!,1
"I’m very disappointed with this product, only worked for 45 minutes and then was dead.The worst part was that wasn’t able to get the money back because the seller is in another country and the chipping was too expensive. The thing is if the seller will sell an unreliable product at least should offer a free return posting.",1
"Love it, but I’ve only had it for a month and it’s started to leak on the side of the mold.",1
"Never buy this product ,bought this to gift for a friend arrived with a bad quality of brown box and the pump is not placing exactly inside the cup .The water fountain sound weird and not a soothing .Dont waste money",1
This is a cheap looking fountain. But the worst is the motor. It is so loud that you cannot hear any water trickling down. A purchase mistake for sure. Returning if I can.,1
So awful. It looks and sounds lovely but as soon as you turn it off all the water leaks out. Fun surprise!,1
"Very disappointed!!! This was supposed to be the finishing touch to our meditation room. When we first put it together, the pump was not working. We got it to work and now you cant hear the water because the pump is too loud.",1
It is a very small fountain and it only lasted two months. The plug was constantly overheated. I am not happy with this overpriced product. It was a waste of my money.,1
Worked well at first but only for 2 weeks then not at all,1
"When my fountain arrived, half of the decorations were either missing or broken. The base was broken and missing a piece so it is not able to hold water.",1
Every water fountain I’ve bought on here so far had been broken. I haven’t had very good luck with them. This one as soon as I took it out of the box the plastic tank was broken. And the way it was glued together in general I’d be afraid to put water in it. It looked like the whole thing would come apart easily. Needless to say I sent it ba I the same day it arrived for a refund. Not going for a replacement to have worse luck with one. Just my opinion.,1
"I returned this product. It is super small and very cheaply made. For the price, it is NOT worth it!",1
This product is not suitable for UK. The fuse went twice after using the adapter. Paid Electrition to completely change the plug to UK one as needed for my wedding and it blew the fuse again!,1
I bought one from another seller that works on and off and it came with two glass balls. I’m glad I had an extra one for this one because the light is a different color it’s yellow and it came with no glass balls,1
"This item was much smaller and more plastic than the older fountain I was replacing. It looked and felt cheap and no where near the price point that I paid. Should be less than half of the cost. Very disappointed with it. The lighting was ok, appearance was small, and it didn’t weight much. Sound was ok. Sent it back immediately.",1
"The media could not be loaded. Ok, so 3 mos later I can give a more realistic review. The cotton cord for the plant is insufficient, so even with additional watering when I refilled it (2x/wk), the plant is as dead as a doornail. The pump is sketchy, so what began as a lovely trickling sound took on a rhythmic dumping sound that's irritating, not soothing. And finally, the best part of all - the body of it developed a slow leak and we didn't catch it until it completely ruined the wood table it was on. So overall, it starts off looking good & ends in a sloppy mess less than 3 months later. So I'd have to call it garbage & a waste if money. Very disappointed.I absolutely love the self watering planted feature. I picked up a little fairy garden plant, added water, plugged it in & it was good to go! It has a nice relaxing water sound, doesn't splash and the appearance is lovely.",1
"This product is not operating correctly. The directions were not helpful. The round light mechanism does not fit in the fountain tubings as the directions said it would. The casing is utterly cheap and flimsy. I definitely want my money refunded. By the time I had one of my adult sons work on it and they were unable to get it to work properly, the return date was past due for returning it.",1
Looks good. No leaks but this is NOT as advertised as being able to hook up to most reverse osmosis water filters which is why I bought it so save more counter top space. I have reached out to the sellar to try to troubleshoot shoot but no response,2
"For garden display but most of the time , the light didn’t on .",2
"I never received the package, after three attempt I cancel the order. more than a month later the refund never been made and Affirm start charging my account today. please send my refund ASAP.Thanks!",2
The XBOX console was in good shape externally but would not read my game discs. I took my discs to a local game store and their original XBOX console was able to read all of them.,2
"Was easy to set up for my daughter. Can't go wrong with a hundred dollar(the suggested retail price) phone that does everything the others do.It's a bit slow, but works lol.Very very slow.Feel over charged at 200$ not a good buy. Id return it but Im too late.",2
"Looks good but I was expecting 2 controllers And A headset. That's what they advertised when I got ahold of am. Azon, they were like sorry, yet their personal guarantee is on this that you will get everything so disappointed.",2
Yep 360S had some internet connection issues which forced me to buy the adapter which is fine. But major problem is some OG Xbox disc CAN play on this but you need the original official hard drive that contains the code. Which forced me to buy and hunt for a new official hard drive ! The hard drive in the picture is a knock off version which contains no special code ……,2
"Just arrived, colours are not as advertised. Ordered only because the jelly fish was blue, however it does not have blue at all.",2
Not worth the hype in my opinion. There was VERY little difference in the before and after for me and my daughter.,2
Not worth the hype in my opinion. There was VERY little difference in the before and after for me and my daughter.,2
I bought this item because of the 5 star reviews.I’ve used this several times with absolutely no difference in my teeth color. I would not recommend.,2
"I was super excited to try this carbon toothpaste that also whitens! The packaging is great and the color of the paste is pleasing to the eye. Here's the thing though, I don't think I'm the target demographic because it did nothing for my teeth. I'm trying not to blame the product because my teeth are pretty stained from when I smoked for years and also coffee. So I didn't notice any significant or even insignificant change to the color of my teeth when I used this but when I switched back to my usual whitening toothpaste, I of course noticed it immediately. Perhaps someone without the wear and tear of my dental history will have better luck. This could work on someone with only light staining on their teeth but unfortunately not for me.",2
"Tastes of grape, that's all, doesn't whiten teeth",2
It did not attach to the toothpaste tube tight enough.,2
"The product comes out as a foaming mess that has a disgusting feeling in the mouth. I tried it anyway, to give it a chance. Absolutely no difference in teeth color than before. Don't waste your money.",2
The seal was broken and the product was very moist from humidity and I will not be using.,2
If I had seen that these tablets were foaming toothpaste tablets I would not have purchased them. I ended up having to go to the store to purchase some without that ingredient.,2
"I expected that each eye would adjust as needed; however, the one eye that I needed improvement appeared to adjust but my other eye, without any sight problem, also adjusted so now I have the same problem but the other eye. Cheaper to keep as back up then return.",2
The autofocus works fine. I just had cataract surgery 4 weeks ago and the second eye last week so I couldn't focus to even use my cell phone. The glasses are cheaply made but will hopefully last for 5 more weeks until my prescription ones arrive.,2
"GOOD QUALITY LENSES BUT THE FRAME IS BROKE IN A MONTH, LIKE I'VE BOUGHT CHEAP QUALITY. VERY DISAPOINTED , SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH MATERIAL THEY STARTED USE , HAD MY OTHER PAIR FOR YEARS AND IT TOOK A BEATING, THIS TIME VERYWEAK CONSTRUCTION",2
The lens came off several times and I ultimately lost one of the pait. The lenses were meticulously cleaned before installation. They worked well until the lens fell out Disappointed!,2
Too Heavy,2
"While I measured carefully, the clips were too narrow for my glasses so I returned them. Lesson learned--seller refunded less than half of the purchase price.",2
"I need very light reading correction (0.5), which these claim to help since they range 'automatically' from 0.5-2.5 in strength. At a normal reading distance for me, everything is very blurry with these on, there is no 'auto' adjusting. The product name also mentions ""multi flex focus dial"". I don't know what 'multi flex' is supposed to mean, but I can tell you there is NO focus dial. As far as I can tell they are plain 2.5 strength readers, which, for me, is way too strong. Color me disappointed and shame on the seller for keyword stuffing their product name with incorrect info.",2
AFTER OPENING THE PACKAGE AND CHARGING THE GLASSES I PUT THEM ON AND THEY SCRATCH MY NOSE. I CHECKED THEM AND THERE WAS NO NOSE PIECE TO PROTECT MY NOSE. I HAD TO RETURN THEM AND ORDER ANOTHER BRAND.,2
Quality is fine for the price but I look like Mrs Claus. lol. I'm not even that old.,2
"I might have ordered the wrong magnification, but I also didn't like the iridescent coating on the outside of the lenses.",2
The lens automatically fog up when you put the glasses on and I think they are low quality lens. Love the look and the replacement batteries but I will not reorder these.,2
"I decided to try bifocals for my first readers, hoping they’d save me from constantly taking them on and off. Unfortunately, they didn’t quite work out. The reading focal area is way too low, which makes it uncomfortable and awkward to use. The focus area is oddly positioned and doesn’t blend well with the rest of the frame, making it look unattractive. While they’ll do in an emergency, the quality just isn’t there. I ended up switching to a different brand with progressive lenses for a much better experience.",2
I've been wearing Foster Grant reading glasses for years and always purchase the same model. The glasses that I ordered were to be Ironman IronFlex black/red framed glasses. Instead of shipping the ordered glasses I was sent unframed glasses blue/grey#dg1123 IM1001 GUN. I was to receive IM2002 model but didn't. Caution buying these glasses.,2
I purchased these to replace my previous pair of the same glasses. These seem to be much larger and kept falling off my head/face. Will be returning these.,2
This is the third pair of these exactly same glasses that I’ve purchased. This pair was loose at the temples on arrival and tightening didn’t resolve the issue. Kept because they arrived at Christmas just before traveling out of town,2
Don’t waste your money on these glasses! Worn for reading only and the lens falls out! The arms are extremely tight. Very flimsy.,2
I dislike the feeling of wearing them and seeing outside the frames and inside. It was very odd and disconcerting. I returned them. They made you dizzy looking up.,2
Cannot wear for a long time as edges are hard. Have to line up perfectly as not to have double vision.,2
I braved the bright morning commute sunshine to test these. (I'm just a passenger) No shading at all. Yes I gave them time sat them on my dash too. No luck. Painful. Wearing my polarized sunglasses I could see some slight rainbow staring on the edges but not enough to tint the lenses. Also the bifocal line is really pronounced right in the middle of my eyeline - and maybe that's just the size of my face I have a smaller head. If you zoom in on my pic you can see what I'm talking about. I could still use inside or at home but only while specifically reading. I don't think I could walk around with the bifocal line.,2
Attempted to catch them from falling from my face and they snapped in 2..,2
Doesn’t cool at room the size it says it does:-(,2
"I usually don’t write reviews, especially negative ones. I liked this product when I initially got it. But after using it for only two summers the pump stopped working even with regular cleaning and maintenance. Because the water is no longer pumped into the filter, it does not actually cool anything. It looks like the pump can’t be easily replaced. So I liked it in the beginning but it didn’t last. Now I just use it as a bulky floor fan.",2
Don't recommend it,2
This unit just blows hot air around and doesn’t measure the temp in the room only the temp of air it’s putting out.,2
"The ice packs would melt and warm up fast, and you only felt the cool air when you are about 2 feet or closer. The fan does not blow hard/fast enough.",2
This product cools my from 95 degrees to about 90 degrees if I’m lucky. Save your money and buy an a/c unit.,2
It stays cool for a few hours and then doesn’t. It’s also difficult to clean as you can’t remove the tank.,2
Don’t cool down,2
Does not blow cold air long even with the ice pack in the bottom,2
I ordered this to cool a bed room for my kids. It’s hot and humid.. the AC UNIT needs work and thought this would help but wasn’t worth it and ima have to return.. I don’t feel the difference from fan to AC it’s all the same the humidifier looks like it works as the vents cleaned my air in 1day the filter was getting fDirty,2
The only time you cool off is if you’re right in front of it.I don’t not recommend and SUCH a waist of money!,2
Annoying flashing lights when off. Ice packs swell too much even half full. Good for a small room but not a powerful fan. Can't complain for the price though.EDIT 9/23/2022: Piece of junk now. Swing function quit working. Pump intermittent and indicator light quit working. Cheap for a reason. Would not buy again.,2
"Received this couple months ago doesn't do much ,,fan works better .not advisable for the money very disappointed",2
What a joke! This cooler might cool you if you stand right in front of it. It would not cool 5 square feet let alone 200 square feet. It is a pain in the but you have to have keep filling it with water and ice bottle (which lasts about 25 minutes. 2out of 5!,2
Wouldn’t buy again.1. This doesn’t substitute an air conditioner2. Works with water and electricity3. You need to have it very close to you to get any coolness4. The water only lasts 4hrs,2
It being to squeals badly after about 6 months of use.,2
"It's an okay unit, tales awhile to get cool air out of the unit and the fan isn't very strong even at max.",2
"Customer Service is Priority ONE with this company--A principal from the company personally called me for feedback on the cooler. I experienced what I thought was an incomplete assembled cooler, but after speaking with the principal/owner, it was apparent they made significant improvements to the unit to allow ice to be used in the water, which cools the air about 30 degrees more than normal. Their fan motors are of superior quality, sealed units. I live in Phoenix, AZ where summer temps are record breaking at 118 degrees, we use our Cajun Kooler coupled with our mister system so we can enjoy being outside on the patio. This unit is superior to others we've tried, and I highly recommend it.",2
haven't used yet,2
"This is a cheaply made unit but it works okay for what it is.Before my actual review, I wanted to mention the ice packs because a lot of reviews complain about them. Yes, the ice packs melt quickly. You'll need to keep a few and rotate them through the freezer if you want consistent ice packs. This is not a product flaw. It's just physics. Putting something frozen in water- a heat sink- makes it melt faster than when just on a surface.Now for my actual product feedback.The air that comes out of it, even without ice packs, is definitely cooler than the air that comes out of an ordinary fan.It isn't strong enough to really significantly cool a space, but for a very small space or for the area immediately in front of it, it works reasonably well. It will be much more effective in an arid climate than in a humid one. To counteract this in the humid area I live in, I simultaneously run a dehumidifier.I had it for about 2 days with it working quite well with constant use. Partway through the third day, it started to leak pretty badly. I opened it up and tightened all the internal screws I could reach, then closed it again. Unfortunately, the leak continues. I will be returning this and trying a different model that is hopefully made better.",2
It doesn’t get really cold!,2
"This cooler is not bad, it just doesn’t cool 1100 square feet! Not even close. It’s actually 1100 CUBIC square feet which is not even a 12’x12’x8’ room. (1152 cu ft) The advertising is misleading. It also takes distilled water so the deposits and minerals don’t clog it up. Amazon has 18 gallons for over $60 so that will get you less than 30 hours. If you have a small room or you put that thing right on you, it’s not much better than a good fan.",2
It was working great but the pump diedIn 4 months,2
"The water tank and the ice things. This thing really aint worth it. Just take the plan and you get a portable ac unit Because this thing it works somewhat, but honestly not enough",2
"As the headline said, the boom mic introduces echo and buzzing, the exact opposite of what I'd intended by buying a more expensive headset. Plus, they only record at 16 bit, 48KHz, well below anything reasonable. Save your money and buy a $5 headset if you want the boom mic, because this one simply isn't fit for purpose. The only bright side is the comfort and the audio out, but the difference of $35 between this and the boom-mic headset I got at 5 Below isn't justified for that.",2
"Never mishandled, but after a year of use the microphone only works when placed at a certain angle now and is very inconvenient.",2
The only real issue with the stand is the shaft and piece the headphones rests on. Its very poor quality. I super glued it together and it lasted another couple of weeks before it broke again with simple use. Spend your money elsewhere.,2
Hooked into A40TR and my voice cuts out very frequently to others I am talking to.,2
"This headset didn’t connect with my xbox what so ever, even though it says it is, would be perfect for anything else though",2
"This is a good looking and useful headphone stand but the RGB stopped working after 2 days of use. Already tried to unplug and plug it again, no luck, holding the rgb button, no luck. It just stopped working and it's disappointing after so little use. If I want to return the item I would have to send it with an international courier service because I'm not located in USA, so shipping it back would cost to me like double the cost of the actual item.",2
This is the 2nd one I have purchased and believed it was identical to the other one. There is no mute option. Don't recommend if your kid games as muting is something they all do.,2
Stop working after one day,2
"This headset is comfortable, the audio is good, the battery life is good. I really like that the mic flips up and down and mute itself when you do so. All the things you think about with a headset are on point. I wish I could end the review there, but everything else makes this thing a pain to use.The main reason I went with this is because I already use some other Corsair peripherals with iCUE. Using this headset with iCUE is actively worse than without. First and foremost, when you're not using iCUE, the headset uses a series of beeps to for audio feedback when you mute or unmute. These beeps are very clear, and they vary in tone in a manner that makes it intuitive whether what you just did was to mute or unmute. These beeps sound whether you click the physical mute button or flip the mic up or down. When the headset is controlled by iCUE, these beeps are completely disabled, and you're left with two options: No mute sounds at all, or use the extremely grating voice prompts. Why can't I just hear the beeps? It makes no sense.You can replace the voice prompt audio with your own .WAV files, but what you'll find is that iCUE has a something like a half-second delay in reading custom .WAV files, and even if there wasn't, there's no active audio connection. The audio connection only starts when audio plays, and it takes an additional half-second *after* audio starts for anything to get to the headset, so it cuts off the first half of the audio. In practice, this means if you have a second long audio clip, you'll only hear half of it. If you have a half-second long audio clip, you'll hear nothing. Why send audio feedback through the audio channel instead of playing them natively on the headset? It makes no sense.Note that this is through the USB dongle with a dedicated connection to the headset. I understand that the various versions of Bluetooth will have these latency and cut-off issues, and that's the main reason why I chose this headset that comes with a dongle. Why does the dongle have the same issues that Bluetooth does? Does the dongle use Bluetooth for its connection? If so, then *what is the point of the dongle*? All phones, all laptops, all consoles, and most desktop PCs (mine included) have Bluetooth built-in. Why ship a dongle that has all the downsides of not having a dongle? It makes no sense.Also, when connected through the dongle, infrequently (but extremely noticeably) something goes completely wrong and the microphone audio just totally corrupts. I haven't had the pleasure of hearing it myself, but multiple times have the people I'm talking to started freaking out about how I was getting sucked into a wormhole. When this happens, it doesn't stop, and the only way to get the audio back in working order is to unplug and replug the dongle. Turning the headset off and back on doesn't even work. I don't know if it's a driver issue or what, but I can't risk a losing customer or client trust because my hardware just fails in the middle of something.So throw the dongle out, right? Just use Bluetooth natively. Yeah, I tried that too. The latency issues with the headset are much worse than what I see with other Bluetooth devices, outside of my $5 set of earbuds. This thing is $50 ($100 with the dongle that makes the experience worse), they couldn't have put a better Bluetooth module in it? I've used no-name speakers with better Bluetooth. Why put inferior components in your mid-range device? I'd say it makes no sense, but it's really just cost cutting at the expense of consumers who don't know any better. (Un)Fortunately for me, I do know better.And one last issue, and last because this might just be my system, but when the headset is connected via Bluetooth, Windows Audio Service uses upwards of 5 GB of RAM and some 10-15% of CPU on my 13th Gen Intel i7. I don't see other connected devices, audio or otherwise, using this amount of resources. On top of that, the headset broadcasts itself as multiple different devices, presumably one to connect to the dongle and one (or more?) to connect via native Bluetooth. This makes it really hard to isolate and troubleshoot any issues, because it's not easy to tell if you need to look at ""CORSAIR HS55 WIRELESS Gaming Headset"" or ""CORSAIR HS55 Stereo"" or ""CORSAIR HS55 WIRELESS HANDS-FREE AG"" or whatever else in device manager or sound settings.I put up with all these issues for a month, swapping between connection methods, trying different settings, googling workarounds, convincing myself that there must be a way to make this thing good. After a month, I have found that there is not. There's no way to use this thing that isn't aggressively bad in one way or another. I wish I could pick and choose different aspects of the different connection methods and combine them into a singular, cohesive, and broadly good experience, but it's not possible. And since the return window closes after 30 days, I guess I'll just be out the cash with a bad product that could be good but isn't. If this is the sort of experience I can expect from Corsair, then I guess I know not to get any further invested in the ecosystem.",2
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this yesterday (4/30/23), when I originally plugged it in and set it all up it worked. Today when I set my controller on it the lights in the bar went absolutely insane. I didn’t think much about it and was gone all day. I came back to my controller not charged and the lights still going crazy. I took it off the charger and the lights work fine. I put my controller on it and crazy lights… my phone won’t even charge anymore when plugged into it. Really annoyed, and will be contacting customer service.Update: I got in contact with the company who makes these and they sent me a new one free of charge… I’ve had it 24/hours and it’s working okay. It’s a little wonky when I set my controller down it freaks out but after about 5 minutes it works like normal.. I will give it some more time before I change my review completely or keep it the same. It was nice if the company to send me a new one though.",2
"Received console and accessories as advertised in the description to replace a similar previous refurbished system that was sent back. Upon trying to power up system after making proper connections, found that the controller would not work. Sent everything back for a refund.",2

The product is not good,2
This item came in the color was distorted. It looks more navy blue and white. Did not look anything like the black-and-white picture shown online.,2
"The paper was very wrinkled and creased and was delivered folded. It would have been packaged with a sturdy piece of cardboard. The paper was also extremely thin (paper meets tissue paper). If the papers were not wrinkled and creased it would have made a decent placemat, but in its current state it looked cheap and I ended up throwing away so many sheets because I couldn't use them for anything.",2
These look cheap. Colors are not realistic. We chose not to use them for our event.,2
"Pros - Placemats are colorful and seem sturdy. Cons - Dozens of errors in the maps. Problems with places being misnamed, colors (sometimes contiguous countries have the same color), the names of cities are larger than the names of states or countries. Names are cut off so you can't read them. These placemats useless for teaching geography, but we are having a lot of fun spotting and discussing errors!",2
Lifeless colors. Returned. Previously a fan of Pimpernel.,2
"Product has edges peeling up after a few weeks, and very difficult to keep these glossy mats looking clean. Poor quality.",2
"Nice print, it is very thin, I don’t think is going to last long, I will have to iron it because it came with wrinkles. Not that happy with them, it looks better in picture",2
Really cheap and thin,2
Product is totally not a placemat. More a coaster!!!! If I was bothered I would return them but as I am incapacitated with a back problem they will be used as very expensive candle base to protect furniture. So disappointed. Just wouldn’t buy them ever!!,2
"Experienced serious performance issues which prompted me to return the product. The issues all involved the Chrome browser. Clicking links on pages, creating new tabs and generally doing anything on the browser stuttered and paused. No other processor intensive activity was taking place, the only thing open was the Chrome browser. The issue went away after a while but I wasn't taking any chances. The experience was so disappointing and I was wary of it happening again that I decided that it was simply best to just return the item.",2
I hardly use the darn thing be it drives me crazy! I needed a new laptop and right now Apple was out of my price range. I am so over & done with windows so this seemed like a nice option. It is very printer fussy. It would work with the one I had but it gave a list of printers that would. I ordered one from that list. Nope. Wouldn't work. I wanted a lighted keyboard. I didn't know that the only lighted keyboard was the touch screen one that insists on popping up constantly when I'm using the other (unlit) keyboard. I really prefer the raised keys of a keyboard over touchscreen for typing. It has some nice features. Holds a charge well. Will store your info so you don't need to enter it yourself but most computers do that. The screen size is nice. But the negatives far outweigh the positives for me. I regret the purchase.,2
"I purchased this unit and really enjoyed it. Even though it was bigger than i normally use, i was going to keep it anyway but unfortunately relentless wifi issues made me return it. Constant disconnects from anything requiring a reliable connection. Amazon luna constantly kicked me out, geforce now and xcloud both had constant disconnects. I couldnt get through a 20 minute zoom meeting without a dozen reconnects. I have other devices, including chromebooks that dont have any issues with my internet. Being a chromebook means i cant swap for another wifi chip leaving me to return. Perhaps it was only my unit but truly unfortunate.",2
"It’s a great buy for the price. There’s no debating that. However, no manual included. I bought it posted as excellent condition. Nothing could be further from the truth. Many scratches on both sides of the keyboard. Surface scratches on the lid. I can actually live with that. Looked like a big dirt stain in the exact middle of the screen. Nope it’s a ding and it’s deep enough to fit the tip of your fingernail. The fact that it actually works is the only thing stopping me from giving one star. I was under the impression this was from Amazon but it’s an individual seller. I’m okay with that but maybe some more transparency and honesty would have me in a better mood",2
"This is advertised as having 64GB storage plus a 64GB MicroSD for a total of 128GB storage. It does come with a MicroSD card and an SD adapter, but there is no place to plug either one in. The instruction sheet shows a location for inserting the card, but that slot does not exist on the computer we received.",2
It arrived without the charger.,2
"This thing was a pain in the neck to set up any software not purchased at the “Microsoft Store.” Even programs that were pre-loaded on the system as purchased could not be activated or accessed without knowledge of how to access the magic handshake that Microsoft support would not provide. I had to go to individual software providers such as McAfee and Adobe to figure out how to enable commonly used programs. Even setting up an existing HP printer was not for the meek..everything defaults through HP’s cloud and, again, no support from HP to enable local print spooling. The speed and user interface is no better than the 8 y.o. Windows 10 system I replaced (forced obsolescence, because Windows 10 won’t be supported past 2025 and many programs already could not be updated). Then there’s this flash-card approach to local storage…what a cheesy way to force users to buy storage space in the cloud. Now I know why iOS and Google based systems are more expensive and likely worth the premium.",2
"This is a very nice and powerful laptop for the price, working well and fast, battery life is not great but fine if you adjust the power setting.The add implies that MS office is included in the laptop, however it is only installed, to use it you can get 30 days free trial (by putting your CC info) but than you must pay.This misleading product info really leaves a bitter taste from this purchase. As a consumer I just want to get what was advertised, nothing less nothing more.",2
"Just like the reviews of this laptop- the hinge cover was missing! As this is for a 13 year old, I am not sure that I want to keep it. With the missing piece, it makes me wonder how long this will last. I gave it two stars because it powers on quickly.",2
I never turned it on or tried charging it. A piece is missing,2
This is the slowest and loudest Chromebook I've ever owned. It will shutdown at random the fan is constantly on. I've not altered the system in any way. I stick to regular updates and maintain recommended security protocols. Super disappointed.,2

"I purchased this after seeing an embroidery digitizer use it in a video online. One of the well-known digitizing software companies even recommends it on its site. While the reviews online seem to vary, I figured at this price it was worth a shot.It arrived quickly. The packaging is okay, though if it had been included in a box with something heavy, I would have concerns about it being protected well enough.The instructions it came with were insufficient at best. They basically say to insert a battery, plug in the dongle to your computer, and the pen will automatically connect as it was paired at the factory. There are no markings on the inside of the pen or in the instructions to tell you which direction to insert the battery.Despite our technical knowledge, neither my husband nor I were able to get this pen to connect to any computer in our household. The wireless mouse I purchased the same day worked just fine though, so that leads me to believe it was a problem with the pen.Holding the pen felt unnatural to me. It's oddly shaped, probably for ergonomics, but it fails in this way.Perhaps others have had better luck, but this is going back and I'll have to do further research on a digital pen.",2

Keep in a drawer for when the cat chews the cord on your normal keyboard to order another normal keyboard.,2
Cheap. Sits crooked. The water doesn't make a dripping sound like it should. It doesn't come out of the top strongly to create A solid stream. It just dribbles out. Very disappointed.,2
"Worked beautifully for a few months, and then kept slowing down until the ball just finally stopped turning altogether. It also started leaking and I was afraid of damage to my furniture, so I disposed of it. A shame--it was a beautiful fountain.",2
"This fountain is beautiful. It is VERY cheaply made, which is why it's a bit confusing on the cost. There is no adjuster for the water flow, no on/off switch (you have to unplug to turn on/off), no adjuster for the led lights. It's a beautifully sculpted piece of plastic. That's it.I have another fountain that has LED's with a remote. You can utilize it as a diffuser and the remote turns the power on/off and controls the water. I paid $5 under the cost of this thing. Contemplating a return due to lack of value. My struggle - the design is poetic to me. For now, just writing a review. I'll see how annoyed I get plugging/unplugging this thing when I leave my office daily.",2
"Was definitely disappointed, and mostly shocked taking it out the box to see how small it was . Even more disappointed cause I couldn’t really hear the sound of the waterfall which is why I bought it.",2
It is So tiny. Its embarrassing small!!Hard yo find a place it won't look ridiculous,2
I'm on a hunt now for a new water fountain. This one just splashes water too much that I need to keep adding water to it 2-3 times a day. The splashes ruined the wooden table I had it on. Find another one. This one is beautiful but loud and too high maintenance.,2
"It’s a nice fountain and works great. But somehow I have to add water 2x per day or the globe stops spinning. It’s not leaking, so not sure why it takes so much water.",2
Motor is too loud .. not worth the cost.. pretty fountain but the motor’s sound is louder than the water sound,2
It was very noisy from the beginning and had to try putting rocks in it for the water to hit. Now after 4 months its broke.,2
Nice little fountain but the LED colors die quickly. The red light is the only one in the rotation that still works and I haven’t even had it a full month.Update: stopped working well after maybe 2 months. Tried it tonight and the motor started making a loud whining noise. Was really nice for the first couple of weeks but quality went down really fast.,2
It worked fine the first few days. Then the motor started making this high pitched whining sound and I found the water level had dissipated extremely fast. So now I can only leave it on for a few hours before the motor starts whining again. I liked the colors and spinning ball but now I wish I had kept the box to return it. Also an on/off switch would be nice. 2 stars for the colors and the ball,2
beautiful but does not have the rubber sleeve.,2
Sent it back the same day I recieved it and didn't re order. I believe I received a defective device. Didn't work when I plugged it in🤷🏽‍♀️,2
It looks good but when you try to turn it on the pump does work but we put enough water in it to get it to work look the way it should like in the pictures it just stops working,2
"I've had this fountain for 2 months. It was a great little desktop fountain. I love the sound that comes from it. Unfortunately, the top piece became unglued and now it doesn't work properly. I was hoping for more than 2 months of use.",2
"This looks great, is nice and compact, and relatively quiet. However, the way the fountain is designed leaves almost no margin for error. It worked great for maybe a week until the pump became slightly weaker, and because the water does not quite make it to the meshed section it just splashes all over the bottom surface and all over the counter. Essentially useless. I mitigated this by putting a little ramp so the water does not splash when it hits, but I absolutely do not believe the pump is high quality at all. I mean, what do you expect for $40, but still...disappointing. Hopefully you'll just get one where the pump works properly for a long time, instead of failing almost immediately, relatively speaking.",2
"Can not hear the waterfall at all. Completely quiet! Very disappointed in no sound of running water. Very stingy with Rocks not enough to completely cover the bottom. Would return, but too much trouble! Thanks anyway",2
"While it is very beautiful and complemented my spa very well, it stopped working after 1 month. Randomly this week it turned off by itself and after I cleaned and inspected it, the light doesn't turn on anymore and the motor also stopped working. I am disappointed as I had high hopes for this.",2
"After 10 months now, fountain has stopped working. I had been cleaning it periodically as it would build up some gunk. But now after once again cleaning, using vinegar, etc. Tried taking it apart, but it doesn't really come apart other than at top cup which is where I would use a small brush. But, alas, It no longer works. Off to the trash.My cats love drinking from a fountain and when old one died after several years, had to replace. This one is perfect size. It has pleasant sound, tho I removed the bell. Can adjust flow and lights to your preference. Good value.",2
"This fountain is beautiful and works great at first! I got mine towards the end of February and it only last me about 3 months before the pump died. I used clean, filtered water and cleaned it out. I also ensured that the proper water levels were kept up and it quit working out of nowhere.",2
"The fountain is nice, but the water pump died after 1 day of running. Disappointed!",2
"I wanted this for the calming water noise but it's too quiet on the medium setting, doesn't pump water at all on the low and the water splashes out when you run it on high for any extended amount of time. It looks great but doesn't fit my needs.",2
Wouldn't fool anyone with its cheap plastic appearance; didn't like at all. Also too lightweight; could get knocked over very easily if you have a cat or dog.,2
The paint they use started to peal off and make water slimy. I only used filtered water for about 2 weeks and water was thick and gooey. When I tried rinsing the whole thing I saw the paint was peeling right off.This also does not make any water sound with the rolling ball in it. It is completely silent. I had to use it without the ball to produce some water sound effect.,2
"Didn't realize it was all plastic, that is on me since it says it in the details. I guess you get what you pay for. The design is annoying, you need to make sure you setup the pump level to what works best for you realizing that any level has a hum that you will hear and its not the white noise hum people can sleep to. if you need to make any change then you have to remove all the rocks, pull up the base , empty the water, make your change and put it all back again. the instructions were poorly lit so they are not very helpful and step 4 says the bead light is for another hole, but then doesn't tell you which hole. When you do figure it out, there is nothing for the light to connect to, you will end up having to glue it into the hole but then that means you have to reglue it every time you need to take it apart. I would suggest going to a one of those niche stores and picking one up already assembled that you can inspect before purchase.",2
"The media could not be loaded. First time I ordered item -water pump motor quit after 10 days. Also as shown in video, floating marble gave rather jarring light as opposed to peacefulThere is no on/off switch on cord either. One would need to unplug directly at outlet. Ordered replacement which quit working after 2 days. Will choose another company for next order.",2
Got this for my wife she had it plugged in for about 2 weeks and then started to leak and is progressly getting worse.,2
"This is as beautiful as you would expect it, just like in the pictures. Easy to install. All good until you plug it in.. damn it, the noise the little motor makes totally covers the soothing sound of the dripping water with defeats the purpose. I will return unfortunately..Update: On a positive note, I just discovered that if I leave it on, after a while the noise subsides, and it actually sounds the way it should.HOWEVER, I just discovered a huge water mark on my desk underneath where the fountain sat. This thing ruined my desk, unfortunately. While getting it ready to return it, after it dried, I noticed that the bottom had a crack that was attempted to be fixed but it didn't seal properly so it leaked big time. Just so you know, I didn't purchase a refurbished product, or used. It was supposed to be a brand new product. Which came with a poorly fixed crack. I'm not trusting this brand going forward!",2
This is the second one we bought. It was replacing the same one we bought before. The first one the motor finally died but we did have it for awhile. The second one completely rusted.,2
Cheesy sent it back,2
I was impressed by the looks and quality but I could not hear the water.I tried different suggestions but still had to put my ear up to it to hear the water flow. There were plenty of rocks which others said there was little.,2
"At first the fountain works perfectly, the pump was silent. But after a while, 3 hrs, it started to make a low humming noise even when the water level was almost full. I checked the pump and realised it was overheating. Sadly, I am not sure what cause this issue",2
"Loved this fountain until it just decided that it didn’t want to roll the ball anymore, so I removed it and used it for about a month after and now it doesn’t work at all. I kept it clean and used as directed and now it’s a goner . I wouldn’t recommend",2
"I loved this fountain when it arrived, water flowed beautifully, the sound was magic, like a river in my living room, the water didn't evaporate quickly so i wasn't constantly refilling. I've had it since June 2024, then about a week ago i started hearinf that noise pumps make when there isn't enought water, I quickly filled it with filtered water and the next morning i heard it again and saw water had seeped down my cabinet and was soaking it, i moved it to the kitchen to see what was happening and sure enough, water is just leaking out of the seams, 3 months of use isn't worth it, look for a better quality fountain, it is pretty and sounded great, but now it's useless.",2
"This is a pretty fountain, though it makes no noise at all. However, there is no hose to connect the pump to the base of the fountain, so you have to just sort of shove the pump to the end of the tube awkwardly diagonally, which means it works, but the reservoir has to be completely full to even reach the pump, and the plate sits on top of the reservoir wobbly and crooked because the pump is in the way. Not impressed.",2
"It was a nice fountain but the back opening was so small that every time I cleaned the inside when the fountain no longer pumped efficiently, I had to spend 30 minutes just to put the clear tube back in place onto the pump. And that didn't guarantee the water would flow properly either. I even cut my finger once. For other fountains I've had before, you could easily lift the top to clean and replace the water with ease. Maintaining a fountain should not be this effortful and difficult. In the end, I donated it to Goodwill because it was simply too time-consuming and frustrating for me. I learned that I will never get another tabletop fountain with a small opening at the back no matter how nice it looks!",2
It was nice for 2 days than the mist stopped working. Very disappointed,2
"I had high hopes for this but unfortunately this only worked well for 4 months before it started to deteriorate and ultimately stopped working. The arms tend to fall off whenever handled or cleaning out your bird bath. The attachments are great however the pump is pretty strong and unless you have a large fountain or pond, the water shoots up too high and the wind blows the water away from landing back in your bird bath. Had to use one of the weaker attachments and didn't get the water trickle sound I was looking for. Overall, this product has a short life span in my experience.",2
This worked when the sun was on it. But not for long with in months it doesn't work at all. ☹️,2
"First, when I received this, it was missing the instructions, missing the piece that keeps it centered, and only came with 2 nozzles. It's pretty straight forward. You find a bright sunny location and submerge it in water and it starts working. That was awesome! I don't know why I didn't get one sooner. However, it was pretty frustrating trying to figure out how to keep it centered so that the the water didn't splash out everywhere. I had to refill it with water atleast twice a day. And because I've had other submersible pumps, I know how quickly they can get clogged. I couldn't figure out how to get the motor open to clean it out, because no instructions, and I didn't want to break it. But I did the best I could making sure it was cleaned out, daily or every other day. This pump totally stopped functioning within 2 weeks! I made sure the panel was clean so that it could receive full sun. There was nothing, that I could see blocking the motor. This was during a busy time for me and I missed the return window. I contacted the manufacturer through Amazon, with no response from them. So now I've wasted money on a pump that was probably a return, and doesn't work. Great concept. Just don't buy this one!",2
Without full sun it just sputters.,2
"It works well in full sun. However, if a cloud passes by, it shuts off. I was expecting it to run for a few minutes but it surely doesn't. I'm not even sure there is a battery and it may just be solar powered.",2
Motor was 1 watt instead of 3.5 watts as shown in product. Overall too light build quality. Costly for this build quality.0,2
"This is great while it works and makes the birds very happy! But there are two major problems. As other purchasers have noted, it only lasts for a few months and gives out. Also, it looks like it's made out of left over plastic junk and drink drinking straws, which may actually be the case. I am going to buy another bubbler, but it won't be this one.",2
"The media could not be loaded. The fountain doesn't work efficiently,spurting water intermittently ,no regular flow,despite full sunlight over it,replacement requested in hope of a fully working one.",2
"This fountain worked really well for about a month. We put it in a large clear tray that you would use for the bottom of a house plant. It was a very inexpensive bird bath for our desert yard and the birds loved it while it worked.The pump gets clogged very easily, which eventually leads to the pump failing. Maybe if you were to wash it off daily, it might last longer. We just didn't take the time to do this. We ended up purchasing a more expensive fountain that came with a filter and had a battery to work when the sun went down.",2
"The fountain was quick and easy to assemble and started working right away, but it quit working after only a few days.",2
"The power only lasted as long as the sun was shining directly on the pump. The output was pretty low. I put this in a bird bath and did not need much of a flow, but it just spit some water occasionally. I placed it where it would get the most sun, but as soon as the sun would not be direct or a cloud would pass over, it stopped. Not what I expected and I did return it. I will try a different one. I went with this one because it was so cheap. I will try a pricier one and see what happens.",2
"Easy to set up, looked great, then died after 5-6 weeks",2
"We were so happy with this product and even though the instructions stated it would need full sun it ran without complete sunlight, until one day it just stopped working. Asked for a replacement from the company but have not had a response.",2
"We bought this in May and it worked great for a couple months.. But now it is dead. We have tried all the suggestions of cleaning filter, shaking, submerging in water and making sure it’s not in the shade. I loved it while working but sorry we spent money for short lived enjoyment.",2

"This pump worked very well, so well in fact that I couldn't use a spry head or it would blow out the water with the slightest breeze. I took off the head and it worked fine. Then, one day I went out and there was almost no flow. Ok, I guess I need to clean the sponge filter. I did so, reassembled it, and ........nothing!This is a great pump if you need it for a few weeks for a special occasion, but otherwise, no dice. Too bad as the solar panel is large and worked well. All I NEED IS Q NEW PUMP, not the tubing or solar panel, but I can't buy just the pump. I've purchased this two times and no bueno either time. Ok, I tried one last time to clean it.I brought it in and removed the sponge filter, yes, it is nothing like the picture to clean. You can't remove anything except a small piece of porous sponge. I removed that and cleaned as much as I could, then took a toothbrush to the ""frame' that holds it, and when I put it back together, voila, it worked again. So the solar collector is great, the pump is meh, and the filter system is the weakest link. I anticipate cleaning the sponge filter about two more times before it falls apart. Without it, the particulates will get sucked into the pump, causing failure since you can't get to the pump motor. I know this is not a 1/4 horse pond pump but a little better filter, or cleaning access would go a long way to the longevity of this pump! I'll change my star level from 1 to 2.",2
"worked well for a couple of months - provided entertainment for folks who saw it.We cleaned it regularly and followed instructions but sadly it has failed, the motor is now longer either working or getting power from the transformer.This is just another cheap piece of equipment symbolic of modern consumerism.",2
"The fountain was quick and easy to assemble and started working right away, but it quit working after only a few days.",2
"There were lots of instructions, but none clearly indicating that the part with suction cups was supposed to line up under the little opening in the middle...suction cups down.It was a very sunny day. The pump was working full tilt; the stream of water went up 6-8"" above the surface.Some splashed out of the birdbath and the rest must have evaporated because within a few hours, the water in the birdbath was too low to pump water.Next I'll look for a spot shady enough for it to work but with less vigor.",2
I was disappointed with the fountain. When there was complete full sun it would work but let a cloud go over head and it would stop. Even if I walked by it the pump would shut off. I also had trouble with the suction cups holding it in place. They were constantly coming loose.,2
"The media could not be loaded. I was very excited when I ordered this product, not so much after I received it! Lights barely worked the first night, they don’t work at all now. water does not work at night. It only works during the day if it’s sunny (thankfully I live in Fla..lol) Solar power to me means it powers during the day with the sun and has power to work when no sun but I guess not. We bought a bird bath for it and the water lasts about 2 hrs…. You have to constantly fill it. I unfortunately just don’t recommend.",2
"The media could not be loaded. The price was right and it shipped fast. There were minimal directions for assembly, but pretty self explanatory. Comes with a variety of fountain tips - which all do pretty much the same thing. I created a small fountain so I didn't need a big spray. However, the biggest negative is that it spurts when there is not full sun. If a shadow is on the solar cell anywhere, it won't work. It will do for this little project but won't buy again.",2
"I like the idea...however, living in reality where clouds are a real thing, if you do not have 100% sun (no clouds, no shade), do not have high expectations. When there is full sun on the panel, it works well. Otherwise, it barely runs. There is no 'battery' that gets charged in case you do have a cloud or two so it all but stops running. The very irritating part though was the tubing provided does not fit the nozzle pieces. I wanted a solar pump to make a small bird bath/water decoration. I am having to constantly move the panel so it gets 100% sun, I had to get an adapter to use the nozzles, and not all of them work with the adapter, so I'm limited there as well. I figure I'll keep this for now, but certainly would not recommend it to anyone else and will likely have to find a better option at some point.",2
"I was happy with how it worked until it quit 3 weeks after using it. I maintained it daily, keeping it clean and and polished. It's a shame I can't get my money back.",2
Does not do much - too little water flow,2
"Was nice to start with, but was not made well and ceased to function soon after purchase.",2
I saw a couple of other customers who get the pulsating and not a full flow and I wish that you could set it out in the sun somewhere and charge it without the pump running. It is evident to me that there is no way for this to hold any charge. This is strictly on demand at the moment. Other fountains do have a means of storing sunlight but not this one does not.,2
"Truly not a fan of this solar fountain, wish I had returned it.It doesn't always work, the motor stops, sometimes the water just bubbles at the base of the sprayer.When it does work, it's very pretty",2
"Worked great initially; however, it stopped working last week, just outside of the 30 day return window.",2
Lasted about two months. Then nothing. Total disappointment,2
I put this fountain out at the beginning of June and it died the last week of August. I cleaned it regularly and made sure it never ran dry. It worked great until it didn’t. I would expect it to last at least one Ohio summer. Very disappointing.,2
"Good points include the accessories, nozels, hose and compact packaging and, unfortunately, a simple returns process. When it did work it managed to pump about 30-40cm head (height from the pump).Bad points: it only worked on full summer sun, clouds made it cut out. Came back the following day to see if there was any improvement - totally dead; sent for returns and will be looking for something a bit bigger.",2
Lasted for about 2 months😡,2
I purchased four of these pumps and returned 3 of them because I need detachable cords for my project. The pumps arrived quickly and my refund was very prompt. I kept one and used it for about a month when it simply just quit working.,2
My fountain quit working a week ago!I want a refund on this item.,2
"I ordered a all black coloured fountain and received black and grey, plus it is not working as well as another fountain I ordered from Amazon....disappointed!Marie :(",2
WORKS GREAT IF THERE'S FULL SUN ON IT....ANY CLOUDS AT ALL FORGET IT. ONE OF THE HOLES ON THE SIDE FOR THE PLASTIC TUBES WAS TO SMALL COULDN'T GET TUBE INTO IT. IT WORKS GREAT IF YOU HAVE A FULL SUN KIND OF DAY BUT THE SLIGHTEST LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD IT JUST SPITS OUT THE WATER.,2
Another disappointment from this company,2
"I put this in a 20 gallon tank set in the ground in my garden, wanting to keep the water aerated to prevent yuck. I didn't like that the solar panel is separate, but I was able to easily place it and run the power line from outside the tank to the center, where I placed it on a rock.The pump only works when the sun is out fully, so on cloudy days and evenings not much happened. And then by late fall, about 6 months later, it just quit altogether. No clogs, and the light comes on, but it simply no longer works.Might be worth spending a little more money on a different product, which I have just done.",2
"Only one of the two fountains worked and the other barely works in full sun. Actually, i think it just stopped. Stay far away. Read the reviews.",2
The “rotation nozzle” is stationary. No lights at all. Ripoff!,2
It only works in direct sunlight. When area becomes shaded in afternoon the fountain stops working. When it is working it spurts less than 1/2 inch. Very disappointed. I trashed it after 3 months.,2
"The pump had plenty of power but the attachments would not stay attached. The Mushroom attachment would slowly come unscrewed as the water flowed and eventually comes off after a few minutes. Not all the pieces fit together correctly either. The extension tube would shoot right out of the pump because there was nothing to keep it tightened. 2 Stars because the pump is fine, but paying twice as much for the attachments is not worth it.",2
"Unfortunately this one is going in the trash since I can’t use it for my application - a pool circulation pump. Might be good for someone but beware it doesn’t seem to have rust resistance coating in the impeller.+ PLUSSES +* It pumps well - pushes a lot of water- MINUSES* Rust - But why would you design a WATER PUMP that isn’t protected against rust?? I tried using it as a pump for a pool but it just spews out brown rust water every time you turn it on.* noise - it’s quite loud. Not crazy loud but louder than I expected. Not sure how loud a pump like this should be but it has a high pitch whine.~ Neutral ~* Finish/craftsmanship. I didn’t put this as a minus since most people don’t really care what their pump looks like. I was surprised at how cheap this think looked. This makes Harbor Freight look like a luxury brand. The paint looks like it was a rattle can job - can scratch it off with fingernail. Hard to describe but metal parts are super thin, parts should have been cleaned up after molding/casting, etc. Just little attention to detail.* Wiring - you need to be able to wire this yourself, which may be difficult for some but clearly states in the description.",2
"The concept is great, but the time it was active was very short, so we were really disappointed!",2
It’s been a year and I have gone through 2 sets of the LEDS! I have them set on a timer to come on at 8pm and off at 1am and I’ve gone through 2 sets already!For the money I would expect the LEDs to last longer!! Total waste of money! Not happy!!!!,2
"Cute little fountain! But, you must keep it in direct sunlight to work. It doesn't shoot more than 6 inches in the air regardless of the noozle you use. Night feature is ok - wish you could control colors. You get what you pay for with this one.",2
The handle broke before I even got it out of the box. Seems a little sketchy already,2
"The fountains were beautiful and exactly what we’d hoped for. They worked the day before the wedding, but the wedding night there was nothing at all. No light and no water. Switches were triple checked. Charging instructions were followed. Battery back-up was the entire point of buying this model. Very, very disappointing.",2
It will only work at direct sun light. If you block the sun a second later it will stop working. This means that there is no built in battery as advertised. Other wise it would have not stopped working when i blocked the sun but would have continued working s long as the battery has some charge. But it doesnt so false advertising no battery is built in this.,2
"Quality is not that high, rollers are weak",2
"I loved the color and got many compliments on it.HOWEVER, I had issues with the wheels and steering the luggage. The wheels were difficult to control the suitcase through the airport. The zipper inside the small suitcase also was messed up.",2
This product is not sturdy nor durable. I used it only one trip and the wheel broke as well as part of the suitcase that left a large gap. The hard shell dented. Hard shell suit cases should withstand the rigorous transfer and transport. These do not.,2
The biggest luggage moves to the side by itself. It needs to be controlled with both hands. It defeats the purpose of the 360 degrees wheel,2
thought that the quality of the suitcases would be a little more sturdy. pretty flimsy. Sorry,2
The medium-sized one had completely fallen apart after 2 months - 2 trips. The handle stopped staying up after one trip & now the main zipper has completely broken. Very disappointed.,2
Wheels broke on both the medium and large luggage. Difficult to get back home from travel. Are there replacement wheels????,2
"I'm definitely not impressed with this set. The only pluses are the look & pockets. The blue is incredible and so gorgeous in person, the pictures do it no justice at all. I ordered two sets (first set had a lining zipper sewed on so wrong it wouldn't zip up the last 5 inches and left a gaping hole through to where the handle pulls up) and both sets had some kind of manufacturing issues. The stitching is a little loose and on the second set they completely went off the fabric of the expansion zipper for about three inches. Pull handle on the smallest case is wobbly. I only kept and used because I ran out of time to mess around shopping for another set. Definitely not the quality I was expecting for the price I paid. But they're very roomy and function well.P.S. I have never left a review but considering the crap I went through, I figured it was worth warning people.",2
"The media could not be loaded. This luggage cracks easily, the first trip the larger one split along the side. On the second trip the medium size luggage cracked around the wheel. This is less than a year old purchased in August 2022, I’ve used it twice and already in need of a replacement. I will see how the company responds",2
"These bags did NOT hold up like the MaxLite 5s I have. All three of my rollaboard bags (this one and 2 MaxLite 5s) packed with the same weight, and have taken the same journeys, the approximate same number of times.The under the seat bag tore within the first two months. Now the rollaboard handle on this one is trashed after only 9 months of use. Even if I had purchased the warranty on these bags, I would still chose to replace them with the MaxLite 5 instead. This model simply does not hold up nearly as well.",2

They only connect sometimes and don’t fit ears well. I have small ears and they were bought for my daughter. Even with the smallest ropes they don’t stay in because the actual ear bud is too heavy.,2
I may be doing something wrong but these ear buds connected for a little bit but now I can't get it to connect with anything anymore. I have not given up but it is disappointing. They are cute.,2
"bought these as a gift for my lil' sis' birthday. they sounded nice and the hello kitty design on the outside is cute, but they broke pretty easily. decent for the price i paid.",2
"it couldn't ne so awful... yet it was good!!!i'm confused about whether i liked it or not!!but i'm already sick this movies!!!there are no twists! there's no suspense, no chills, nothing at all!!got busted!!",2
"Mos Def ( I think his name is ) had the most annoying voice throughout the whole movie. I wish he would shut up about his stupid cake shop already. If people were trying to kill me I wouldn't keep blabbing about the most senseless things on and on and on. People are coming to kill me, why don't I talk really loud so they can find me. Was he mentally challenged or what? I was able to watch the whole movie as the two main characters were fun to make fun of ;) Enjoy talking like Eddie (Mos Def) for hours after you've seen it to amuse your friends.",2
"Nicely acted, nicely photographed. The script, however, is confusing, pretentious and self-indulgent. The screenwriting is just awful. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up.",2
"This movie has a great number of laughable moments, but underlying the story is a great antipathy to humanity and decency. Burroughs has sold out to the cheap, scatological laugh, and we are all diminished by it.The story, ""a memoir"" is so patently false that it is no wonder that the family portrayed has sued the author, publisher, and Sony, and has collected.I will not read (or watch) anything from Burroughs again. I am surprised that the artists stooped to this.",2
"To any of you interested in this film, I highly recommend reading the book instead. It seems that the movie just couldn't cover any of the erotic detail that add to the book's highly intriguing, eccentricity. I was very disappointed after watching the film, although Joseph Cross did play Augusten well. And Annette Benning did play the mother... They just played this one way too safe in comparison to the book. It sucks that greatness can be so censored.",2
"Extremely good cast and acting, but of course not as good as the book. Definitely not a comedy as some have described, and is a slow goer.",2
"The back of the DVD case called the movie a ""wickedly funny"" tale. Not true at all. It is one of those very warped movies, true or not, that makes you feel sick to your stomach. I tend to like the more unusual, moving films, but this is over the line. Reminds me of the Squid and the Whale. I feel very sorry for the author if this truly is based on his life.",2
"I had high expectations for this movie - I had read the book and knew that the cast had great potential. The actors were great in portraying their roles - from Annette Bening as the eccentric mother to Gwenyth Paltrow as the obedient daughter, but the plot of the movie missed the biting dark humor that had put the novel in the top 10 of my collection. I'm afraid that, if I had seen the movie before reading the book, I might not have read the book.",2
"Make no mistake: Annette Bening does a fantastic job here as the mentally unbalanced, frustrated poet, and mother of the real life protagonist, Augusten Burroughs. Alec Baldwin does a nice turn as the alky father, while Paltrow, Wood, Cox, et. al. portray the messy and crazy Finch family which adopts Augusten for a while. Joseph Fiennes is also great in his role as Augusten's sometime lover.Sure, it's a great cast, but the year that it covers seems to drag on and on, with pervasive musical interludes, an unbelievable portrait of the Finches and their ""house,"" and it is a chore to get through this film. There seems to be no point or purpose, there is very little humor, and it is quite unsatisfying as a memoir.Too bad these actors are wasted.",2
"If you want to watch a depressing movie about a crazy family then this is the movie for you. Yes, anyone who can survive this is truly remarkable but was marketed wrong as a comedy. I found nothing funny about it. The acting was good, but not what I expected.",2
"Polarizing performance by Annette Benning. Great cast that followed the story-line as true to the acclaimed novel as possible. An abstract story, entertaining in nature but drags its feet.",2
"I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Running With Scissors"" and was thrilled to learn that they were going to make a movie of it. Sadly, the movie was a big disappointment. Yes it follows the plot-lines of the book, but Augusten Burroughs's wry, entertaining voice is completely lost in the translation. The movie plods along, and although Annette Benning is terrific, and Evan Rachel Wood good also, they can't save this one. The worst thing about it is actually the soundtrack-- not the music itself, which is a grab-bag of unremarkable 1970s songs-- but it's loud, intrusive, and badly placed. Again and again the characters are talking OVER a song and you can't even hear them.Save your money. Buy Augusten Burroughs's next book instead.",2
"I read the book, and for some reason had very high expectations. The book was quirky, sad, eccentric, horrific, and redeeming all at once. But the movie was just horrific from the very start. The character depth was nonesxistent, the plot was dismal, and the script was, for a lack of a better word, atrocious. Even though the adaptation tried to remain faithful to the book, all the scenes seemed to be lacking the spark and charisma that Burroughs had in his writing. I pictured the characters differently, and seeing them on screen as three dimensional figures, I realized they were better off on paper. The book is definitely worth the read, but the movie should be forgotten quickly. When will authors learn?",2
"While this review won't be very detailed, I think the point will be quite clear:read the book, skip the movie.",2
"like i said in the title the book was awesome. i loved the dark humor and if you have read the book...I absolutely loved augustens personality in the book. his ideas of doctors and how they should be...the way he describes himself and his love for shiny things...just his whole personality as a child in general was HILARIOUS but I didnt see much of any of that in the movie. also, I HATE how hollywood adds so many scenes that were NOT in the book...that book had more than enough crazy messed up GOOD scenes in it that it by no means needed more that didnt even exist for the movie. overall, i would recommend watching the movie if you HAVE read the book because its cool to see a book come to life on the big screen.",2
"no wait, this movie is a demo of what it feels like to take a valium. Jill Clayburgh is the one bright spot in this snoozer.",2
"I have read Augusten's book which was witty despite it being somewhat 'shocking' the bunch of dysfunctional weirdo's in the mix.I watched the movie in agony. Excrutiating. All the humour was missing, although if they wanted to portray all the agony and discord, they did get it right x 100%There was one laugh out loud bit, rather amusing, the poetry reading by Neel.....The cover I saw had on it 'hilarious, amusing' It is anything but. Not for the light hearted.",2
"I can certainly understand some of the issues driving the story, but I can't relate to this film. I feel nothing for any of the characters. Visually and performance-wise, it's terrific. Storywise, I guess I prefer more sober approaches to telling a story. I understand that this script is based on fact, however, if that's the case, they are people toward whom I shrug with a ""so what?"" I can appreciate off-the-wall humor; I loved ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" for instance but ""Running With Scissors"" doesn't work. Sometimes it's just that strange x-factor which, for me, is in play here. I can't recommend this film at all.",2
"In the original CD release from Rykodisc, we got music aplenty but sloppy sound quality. In this brand new rerelease under a new label, we get better sound quality but less tracks! ARRGH!!And as if to add insult to injury, the new cover art is terrible--this does NOT look like Marilyn Monroe is the least! It may seem a slight complaint to some, but I loved the cover art of Rykodisc's release much better.Looks like we'll all have to wait for the next label to pick this one up to do a better job. Better luck next time, I suppose... hopefully the old saying about three being a charm is correct...",2
"maya 4.5 savvy is just the old blue mastering maya book with a new cover, its the same stupid child and stupid dog from the previous version..very few ground breaking moments...they used to corner the maya instructional book market..but now they need new content..I don't reccomend it to my students.., however there is one beautiful image of a yellow rusted robot that is contriubuted by a third party artist",2
"OK, if you are into John Wayne nostalgia, but doesn't stand up well to contemporary film action, adventure or historical movies",2
"John Wayne as Davey Crockett? I rest my case. I gave it 2 stars because it is ~not~ as terrible as watching the Duke as a Roman Soldier or Genghis Kahn. Those 2 roles were beyond funny/bad. This is a bad movie with ""Hollywood-1950's- I hate commies"" written all over it. Stinks.",2
"This version of John Wayne's The Alamo is 2 hr and 40 minutes from MGM. This is disappointing as MGM released the 3 hr and 20 minutes version on VHS several years ago. Missing from the DVD version are the ""Jeffersoian speech"" between Col. Travis and Capt. Dickinson, the ""death of Emil Sand"", ""conversation between Col. Travis and Col. Bowie regarding Col. Fannin"", the ""death of the parson"" and ""the Alamo defenders talking about God"" to name a few. The ""collectible booklet"" advertised is a two page fold out. I recommend anybody wanting to see The Alamo buy a copy of the restored orignial director's cut on VHS.",2
"I don't even remember where I purchased the DVD version - but, I too noted the absence of the Overture, Entre Acte, Intermission and Exit Music. I don't remember if I ever owned the VHS version - but, may have sold it after I purchased DVD - believing I was getting a 1:1 replacement. I recently - this month being the anniversary of the actual battle - set out to purchase it on Blu-ray - and was shocked to find it wasn't available! Given the number of much lesser films that have been released on Blu-ray, does anyone have any idea why this one hasn't?? Is this possibly a carry-over from the original biased treatment following it's initial production/release (e.g., winning only one of seven oscar nominations)???",2
"Having seen the wide-screen version, this video was very disappointing. I expected the same movie. I couldn't even sit through the first hour because they kept on cutting out parts that I remember from the full-length wide-screen version. Very disappointing considering you can't return videos that are viewed.",2
"If I may commit treason in the eyes of all John Wayne fans--this was NOT the movie for him! Most of his roles (most notably ""True Grit"") he just fits into, as though they were written with him in mind (and most probably were). This one just doesn't work for him. John Wayne is NOT Davy Crockett; he just says the lines and valiantly dies when the script says the time is right.",2
"If you want to waste 2-1/2 hours go ahead. Not worth watching it, slow and boring with a horrid ending.",2
"If you like your history glossy or very watered down, this is the movie for you. Hey, loved Wayne in many, many movies BUT, as history buff and Texan, (San Antonio - no less) this is the most atrocious conveyance of history ever. After viewing this movie, one is lucky to know that there was a 'real' place called the Alamo and that somewhere along the way there was some battle in someplace called Texas. Umm, lemme see, the attack after sunrise, Bowie actually not bed-ridden, Travis dying by the sword and then breaking it? Yes, it's spectacle, it is wordy but historical IT IS NOT. Please save your money and buy a book on the Alamo by Walter Lord, ""A Time To Stand"".",2
"Maybe the most influential moive of my life (I saw it when it came in in 1960 when I was 10) I have since viewed it numerous times. The best part of the movie is the wonderful set and the music. But after learning what one can learn of this fight, it is almost too sad to see this movie as a typical 1950's flick. Terrible screenplay which lessens the grit that we want to bestow on the heroic dfenders. The ""Travis-Bowie"" conflict is tense, but historically misses the fact: they argued over command, not strategy. As for the set itself, I have been there 3 times and it is worth the visit. In some ways it holds the sense of the defenders isolation; the real Alamo in San Antonio has been altered so much that it is hardly recognizable. As for the ""truth"" of the Alamo itself? One must look into their own soul and find the meaning there. Bravo to the Duke for trying.....I still love Arthur Hunnicut the best...AND Fess Parker......but let's see who will do it next, and what they can do.",2
"HELP NEEDED FROM ALL YOU ALAMO FANSCan anyone let me know where I can get hold of a copy of the book titled ""John Wayne's the Alamo : The making of the epic film"" by Donald Clark & Christopher P Anderson. Many Thanks",2
"""The Alamo"" was a vanity project for Wayne that he spent nearly fourteen years trying to get made. Unfortunately, he was so busy trying to push his conservative political agenda that he failed to make an effective movie. At over three hours long, it is meant to be an epic. Unfortunately the climatic battle lasted only an hour in real life and what led up to it was a long slow siege. The film might have been more effective if Wayne had built up the tension during the siege. Instead, his characters are too busy gving windy speaches and otherwise just occupying screen time. And as a villian, Santa Anna is completely colorless rather than being the classic movie bad guy that he should be. Overall, a would be classic that fell well short of the mark. Nice cinematography, though.",2
"This shortened version leaves out some critical scenes that were on the original that was on VHS. The originial had the most beautiful music before, in between, and after. But this version falls way too flat on all accounts. Why ruin a great movie that was a classic western?",2
"Having the VHS version of this wonderful movie with surround sound and the director's cut I looked forward to the DVD being released. Unfortunately, the distributors have short changed all of us here by releasing the short version of the film with 2 Channel Stereo and no Overture, Intermission or Exit Music. Come on guys, look at what the VHS offers in content. Surely the DVD should be just as good or better!!!!!",2
"Euro-pro T021 You cannot use it at 450. It goes into E-2 and cannot get it to do any thing except set the clock. This happen to me before , but after sitting a day, it finally decided to work again. I made the sad mistake of forgetting that it does not like temps over 350. So now I will wait till tomorrow and hope it will work again. There is nothing in the manuel for any error codes.",2
"I expected more from a Patricia Cornwell book than this delivered (and I pre-ordered based on her previous work!). Quite frankly, it was a reprise of her other novels, someone's out to ""get"" Dr. Scarpetta's position, there's sabotage in the lab, niece Lucy is stressed out again and Marino, is well, Marino and the most put together character in this book.",2
"Maybe it's me, but Cornwell has turned Kay Scarpetta into a bitchy, controlling character - a most unpleasant person and probably horrible to work for. Marino is cynical and constantly complaining.Whatever happened to their professionalism?",2
"Could you just tell me when Kay is coming out already? And just how is it that every female Lucy is partnered with wants her hand in marriage? Poor Pete can't find a nice bowling alley babe, but Lucy has no problems here... As has been the case of late, I was disappointed by Black Notice. A very interesting case and intriguing departmental politics all go nowhere. I love Scarpetta and wish that Cornwell would return to old form; writing a true mystery and not a novel worthy of Oprah's book club. I am left with more questions at the very speedy end of this novel than answers (why did the killer's parents hide him? Why does Kay 'not love' her sister? Why is Lucy absurdly angry?? Isn't there one woman in Richmond who can appreciate Pete Marino? And when is Kay going to realize that she really is the perfect role model for her niece?) Let's hope the next one is better....",2
"I am an avid reader of Pat Cornwell's novels. Point of Origin was heartwrenching. But I was extremely disappointed with Black Notice. It was disjointed, vulgar, and implausible. PLEASE BRING BACK BENTON!!!!",2
"I was reading through some of the reader reviews and one reviewer called Marino the most ""put together"" character in the book and I realized with a start that this was true! How unexpected that this overeating, cigarette-smoking, tough and prejudiced cop would be the one to stay grounded, while ""Bang Bang"" Lucy struggles to stay balanced and Kay struggles to find peace and people that aren't out to get her. Problem is, I buy the Scarpetta books to read about Kay and her WORK, not the emotional stuff, and not to see how 90's Marino is becoming. Great forensics, as always, but a mess of emotions, a mess of a plot, and a silly ending that was just too abrupt.",2
"As I read this book, I kept having the feeling of I might have read it before but forgot the title and accidently bought it again. The office problem, Kay's threat from the criminal and the boss, etc. are almost the same as in the other books, and the ending was also very disappointing.",2
"A 200 page story in a 415 page book. Enough with Lucy and her love life! Get back to science and medicine, elements that made the previous books so enjoyable. Please give us more than a 1 page climax in the next book. Worth reading in paperback, definitely not worth the hardcover price.",2
"Patricia Cornwell has become quite the disappointment. Her earlier books were all exciting; I couldn't ""put them down"". Now I doubt that I'll ever ""pick another one up"". The plot never got off the ground and the ending was a real let-down. Sorry Ms. Cornwell, you've lost a fan here!",2
"I was very disappointed with this particular book. I was hanging in there until about the last 25 pages or so. We got to France and the book just fell apart. It wasn't that great to start with, but some hairy guy. Please. The romance was wrong, the Lucy character is disgusting and just rude. I love Patricia Cornwell, but at the French trip I was ready to throw the book in the trash. I suffered through, but I hope this is her worst, and I will look for suggestions from you other readers for my next. I have not lost faith in this author. Even her wrost has a way of always holding my interest. To me this is a great writer, who just decided to write crime novels. She has great potential.",2
"The angst and psycho babble are much too much and too Hollywoody adolescent. This seems to be less a novel by itself and more her editor's strikeouts from Point of Origin - like the cuttings on a film editor's floor. The book drags and the emotional pain -- oh the pain, oh the pining, oh the melodrama, oh the psychological analysis -- pleeeze. Sophomoric. Reeks of being put together hastily for a deadline. Having read similar readers' comments about her newest novel, it sounds as if her good books are sadly all in the past. They were great while they lasted.",2
"Unfortunately I gave Cornwell yet another chance to return to the form that made her early books gripping and a worthy read. This one is filled with the now trite themes we've seen before: power brokers plotting against Kay to remove her from her job, internal suspicions at the office, the angst of her personal life, the sniveling and relationships of niece Lucy, and what appears to be the ever increasing stupidity of Marino. The only refreshing thing in this book is that the villian is not apprehended in the bedroom of her home. Thank you Kay for running outside. Sorry Patricia, no more for me.",2
"I used to enjoy the Scarpetta series, beginning with the first novel, Post-Mortem. I drifted away after From Potter's Field, because I was tired of serial killers. What I enjoyed about those first novels was the realistic setting, characters and scales of the crime. I started reading again with the last novel and now this one. The characters have become unrealistic, jet-setting James Bond types, although James Bond doesn't spend so much time whining and complaining. These are really unpleasant people investigating ridiculously complicated crimes. This book's minor characters and sub-plots make no sense (Diane Bray?) and Cornwell's technical writing skills have deteriorated terribly. She also seems so focused on some kind of personal agenda about women and sexuality . . . I don't understand what's happened to this series.",2
"Patricia Cornwell continues her downhill slide. Although not as bad as her last several books, Black Notice is a big disappointment. The story line is full of holes, questions and unrealistic nonsense. The book also has an unpleasantly misogynistic tone, especially when dealing with the odious Diane Bray. I can only assume Patricia Cornwell's personal issues are spilling over into her work. Bring back the old, intriguing Kay Scarpetta and gang, not this whiny bunch.",2
I have read all of Patricia's books. This book took me forever to get through. I found it very hard to believe everyone was out to get Kay. Lucy needs some new focus........I have always liked all of her characters....but this book just didn't endear them to me. Will be difficult to rush to buy the next book in this series......and I buy many books! I will read the reviews on the next one before I buy another disappointment.,2
"I was slightly dissapointed with this book. There was very little character development, and the plot starts out with a bang then drags out, before it is wrapped up in very few chapters.",2
"Cornwell seemed to be resting on her laurels with ""Black Notice"". I found the story to be disorganized and hard to follow. She introduces several elements, but then goes nowhere with them. I felt the story ended with several threads left hanging, or with forced conclusions. She would have done better to simplify the plot and leave out some of the extraneous story lines.",2
"The book started off strong. I was really getting into to it, I didn't want to put the book down, until the end. What a disappointing ending, it's as if Patricia Cornwell didn't know where she was going with the story so she decided to quickly throw an ending together. It didn't do the book justice!",2
"Imagine escaping death at the hands of a crazed killer, not once, not twice but over and over and over again and still making the same stupid mistakes. Perhaps Dr. Kay Scarpetta has a death wish... Why would someone trained to deal with death not know all the stages of mourning, and not seek counseling?Why is it such a big deal that Lucy is gay and why is she protrayed as such a loose cannon?To say I wasn't at all pleased with this read which was slow going until the halfway point would be an understatement. Unless Dr. Scarpetta and her niece get some psychiatric help, I won't be following her exploits any more.",2
"After I read her last book, Point of Origin, I was hesitant in buying into Ms. Cornwell again. Being optimistic, I bit for this one. And it did not bite back. In fact it gummed me to death. Did anyone else find the dialogue so cluttered a dustbuster couldn't clear it up? I do not like to *dis* any book or any author, they do something I cannot--write. However, in good faith, I cannot recommend Black Notice due to poor plot, dialogue, & frustrating folly.other reading suggestions: ""Bleeding Out"" by Baxter Clare, ""Ashes To Ashes"" by Tami Hoag, and ""Manhattan Is My Beat"" by Jeffrey DeaverThanks for your interest & comment vote--CDS",2
"Oh, my. What is with this whole conspiracy thing. Let me premise this by saying that I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and was looking forward to this one coming out, but what a disappointment! Why must Lucy somehow be connected to all of Kay's cases. How realistic is that. Oh, how I wish that she would go back to the earlier storylines where there was just some serial killer out there, and Kay and Marino just went out and did their jobs instead of all of this highly implausible international intrigue that Ms. Cornwell makes us plod through. I don't know how many more books that Ms. Cornwell can put out about these characters, because they're apparently all about to have nervous breakdown's! If you're also sick of these crazy plot twists, check out Kathy Reich's books, they're alot like the early Cornwell ones. Pure science and thriller, none of this crazy mess.",2
"I really love her Scarpetta-books, but this is a true disappointment. Wimsical, sometimes uncomprehensive. And the end are so flat and short that you wonder if you lost the last twenty pages. There's a lot of promising plots that Cornwell starts but she seems too unfocoused to give them a satisfactory solution. And please, Madame Scarpetta, stay in Richmond. The Paris excursion with the ""Hunchback from Notre Dame""- theme are a bit too thick for European-audience.",2
"A good strong start with 'traditional' attention to detail in both setting and characterisation. However I am unsure how many of the Scarpetta novels have now featured the criminal at Kay's doorstep. Move house, change telephone number, get better security ..... develop an original ending? Do something to save this enjoyable character (and another Southern Cross is most definitely not the answer!)",2
"Scarpetta is a detail freak in her work but has no concept of follow-through in her life. Things happen that are just ignored, it seems like the plots are a pastiche of paragraphs about Scarpetta which are forced into a chronology by her editor. The woman can write; I wish she'd take a story idea, outline it to figure out what she wants to say and where she wants to go, then go there. There's brilliance, and great sentences, solid characters, good science. But what holds them all together? The binding.",2
"Any book with 275 reviews doesn't need another but--being from Richmond and all (note to author: VA State employees do not have access to AOL. Note to Readers: any comparison between Marino and an actual Richmond police captain is insulting.) Gave this two stars because the first 1/3 is paced briskly; a few new characters are introduced (non-serial killing non-monsters). Things are looking good. Then Kay goes to Paris, and it's all over. Her monster is laughable, it drags, you don't care, and your spirits lift at the end because you know it's almost over.You heard it here first. She's going to kill off the obnoxious Lucy. We'll have to suffer through Kay's spasms & histrionics of grief, but it will be well worth it to never be confronted by that wretched girl again.",2
"This is my first Patricia Cornwell book, and I'm disappointed. The dialog is sharp and not convincing. The book reads more like a made-for-TV mini-series than of a novel. There is an excessive number of subplots, none of which deal with catching the ""werewolf"". I'll give her one more shot to impress me.",2
"i thought i had misunderstood previous reviews and that this was going to be one of the better books. what a confusing plot; then to end the book as quickly and as incompletely totally irritated me. i don't think i've ever walked away from a cornwell thinking that it was a waste of time and money but this time, as much as i hate to admit it, i did. for a beter read, plick of james patterson's new: pop goes the weasal",2
"Come on, Ms. Cornwell, lighten up! Black Notice was a splendid yarn about a Werewolf but so many sub-plots were thrown in, the character-development and his origins were buried. I have always loved big, brusque, protective Marino but in this one his disgusting behavior was a real turn-off. He typified the ""ugly American"" when they were in France. And where was your usual grand and glorious ending tying in all the loose ends? This one seemed to just abruptly stop.From the description of the killer, with his long body hair, ugly face and pointy teeth, it was completely illogical that SOMEONE didn't spot him long before the end.",2
This book was a disappointment after reading all the other books written by Ms. Cornwell. It was gloom and doom from start to finish. It was extremely depressing.,2
I was about half way through the book before I realized I had never read a book where each character was more unhappy than the previous one. Depressing and uneventful.,2
"Even more unbelievable than the last. How has the earth managed to continue life as we know it before Kay and Lucy? PLEEEZ! Lucy is way too smart and pretty and computer-whizzed, blah blah blah. Oh and by the way, a lesbian. What is that about? I swore I wouldn't read another one of her books. She should have quit after the third - first three were very good. But they just get so outlandish and silly. Inane. Who cares? No more Cornwall for me - I swear.",2
"For the past couple of novels, Cornwell has left me disappointed on how she ends her books, no buildup at all, just the killer popping up out of nowhere to try and kill our heroine, Kay Scarpetta. This book has been the worst yet. With 10 pages to go I'm wondering, where is this going??? I was very disappointed with Black Notice and hope that Cornwell becomes a little more creative on how to wrap up her stories.",2
"A new book starring Kay Scarpetta is guaranteed to cause me to pull out my checkbook immediately. Unfortunately, like many of the other reviewers, I found Black Notice a disappointment for a number of reasons. Wesley Benton was a moderating influence in previous stories, and I miss him greatly in the current book. Kay Scarpetta seems less organized, more bitter, and her angst colors the entire story. Lucy has become a distraction, rather than a contributor to the storyline, perhaps she should have been the one killed off! I would also agree with one of the other reviews that the ending of this book was hurried, poorly crafted and undeserving of the hundreds of pages of buildup.",2
"Having worked with pathologists and ME's in my life. I find them interesting people. I also like to read fiction starring their profession, regardless as to how far out from reality they may be. It's fiction, right?But this offering from Cornwell isn't her best work. The whole book felt like a rehash of old sections of previous work. Was it worth the read? I suppose. I read most of it on a plane when my expectations were pretty low when it came to entertainment so it was fine for me. But the murderer wasn't very compelling and the regualr characters from the series seemed warmed over and predictable.I like Cornwell's work, but this felt more mailed in than well-thought. Don't run out to get this one, but if you find it in the used paperback bin, it's worth picking up for a rainy day.",2
"You never realize how truly disappointing a book can be until you realize that there are approximatley fifty pages left and countless plot lines flapping in the breeze. Cornwell is a master storyteller. Unfortunately, Black Notice if incredibly similar to many of Dean Koontz's books in that the author tells a great story but has no clue how to tie everythign together and end the book. Like Koontz, Cornwell chooses to simply end without tying up many of the plot lines.My advice, don't waste your time.",2
I am normally a fan of Cornwell but this one is over the top. There is a LARGE amount of unnecessary detail in this book that makes you want to scream or at least keep turning the page until you get to a part that matters. The various plots jerk you around many times. The characters seem to say the same thing over and over again. I found the whole book frustrating to read and finished it in the hope that it would get better!,2
"The main story line doesn't even start until halfway through the book. There are some half-hearted attempts to tie everything together, but they don't really work.And what's with the niece and her relationship? Its as though Cornwall feels she has some obligation to include a dysfunctional lesbian relationship. WHY?? Its not as though the book's about homosexuality, and its not as though there is an integral character who just happens to be a lesbian. Its pointless. And Lucy is SO unsympathetic.I guess the worse part is that its not really a mystery. There are no clues that would allow the reader to figure anything out. Everything is resolved abruptly. Scarpetta doesn't figure anything out.",2
"I devoured the first Scarpetta books, but ever since Cause of Death, reading her books is continually disappointing. I mean come on a killer with excessive body hair, a warewolf? This is more like an X-File episode, and don't misunderstand me I love the X-Files. However, Scarpetta and Marino aren't Scully and Mulder! Also, like other reviewers have written I am little sick of the Lucy storyline.Quite honestly I think the best of Scarpetta is in the past. I am now on a new series by Dennis Lehane and it is absolutely fantastic! Try him instead.",2
"As a faithful Cornwell reader, I cannot help but be discouraged by this most recent literary nosedive. The book is poorly executed, characters not fully developed, and the story line lacks Cornwell's usual spine-tingling twists and turns -- and ultimately a satisfactory conclusion. Can this reader be saved? Yes...if Cornwell's upcoming book is worth my time...but guaranteed I'll wait for paperback.",2
"Okay, Scarpetta, get over yourself. Sure, your life is tough, but whose isn't? At least you're not as cranky as you were in your last go-around. And tell me, when did you stop being a simple medical examiner and start saving the world from every lunatic out there? You might want to speak to your supervisors, 'cause they're putting a helluva lot on your shoulders. And do me a favor, will you? Slap Lucy for me. I know it must be hard to be so smart and find out your ex-lover is a pyschopath, but gimme a break. And if being gay in the '90s were as tough as she makes it out to be, I and a whole lot of other people would've slit their wrists long ago. Doesn't anyone in your family find joy in anything? Maybe this new young stud of yours can knock some sense into you. I hope so, 'cause your adventures are becoming just a little too depressing for words.",2
"For readers who want a well-crafted suspense story, skip this immature, feeble attempt at mystery. In this particular selection, Kay Scarpetta is an emotional cripple as testified to by the rampant adjectives that describe her delicate condition post her lover's death. This novel was grossly disappointing because of its consistent use of similes that test the patience of any well-read reader. Similes are sprinkled everywhere as if someone wrote a prescription for this novel that ordered a certain amount making the work silly, almost laughable. For a professional cornoner, the main character is both unprofessional, consistently a blithering woman and hangs onto a detective, in Marino, who was grabbed out of the 1950's with his wisecracking, emotional outbursts, and immature and unprofessional behavior of a New York City dectective. Sorry, but this novel is just plain a waste of any intelligent reader's time.",2
"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books up to this point and have enjoyed them all. I did not, however, enjoy Black Notice. Rather than focusing on Dr. Scarpetta's work, there was WAY too much focus on who was out to get her. I want to read about the cases she solves, not all the black stuff that's going on in her own life. Some is OK, but not half the book. All of Cornwell's previous books were full of excitement, but Black Notice dragged on and on...",2
"Black Notice is the beginning of the dark period for Patricia Cornwell. Don't get me wrong, I love serial killer books, but her books keep getting darker and darker - depressing to read.",2
"This is a really poor effort by Patricial Cornwell. If this had been the first book of Cornwell's that I had read, I would have been likely to not read any more books of hers. Instead of a good mystery, we are offered extreme details of office politics and a slow moving plot, with a B-movie climax. The characters are extremely caricaturized here, and there also is a lot of self-righteousness and self-declared vulnerability on the part of Scarpetta. Overall, this one can be skipped.",2
Disappointing. This was the first of the series that I read. I couldn't figure out the background so I never got into the story. The end wrapped up too quickly and then just dropped off.,2
"I read Black Notice yesterday, and was pretty frustrated. Thebook jacket talks about a transatlantic mystery, but why does it take3/4 of the book to get to France? Because we need to hear about how everyone is out to get Kay (again). I keep reading this series hoping that it will return to form (see Postmorten), but it's just getting more sloppy. At one point, Cornwell tells about how bacteria are breaking down the Container man's cell walls. Cell walls? Didn't she learn in high school that only plants have cell walls? One example of how she doesn't care enough to put enough thought and effort into a medical mystery plot. Doesn't she know that most serial killers are not freaks of nature, and the fact that they are generally perceived as just like you and me is much more scary than anything she has conjured up in a while?",2
"After reading ""Black Notice,"" I felt I should call the NYPD to see if Cornwell is holding a gun to her editor's head to force publication of yet another whiny, confused, poorly edited and ultimately infuriating Scarpetta novel. Readers of series do enjoy growing with continuing characters, but just as in the one preceding this volume, ""old"" characters are plopped in without adequate introduction, thus mystifying new and less-devoted readers as to the details of previous actions and hence the effect on present motivations. Cornwell needs to take a long rest before tackling any more Scarpetta volumes!",2
"This book just follows the life of Kay Scarpetta round and round, all her usual cronies and loves but I haven't heard about the murders since the very beginning. I've forgotten what the book is about. And some say there is 'blue' language. I'd call it 'black', and you must tolerate M___F__ing on every single page, times 3, the whole book, plus extra G-D-ing, blasphemy,etc, and the only thing I haven't had to endure is a sex scene--thank goodness. Not done yet, though. Am close to the end, and this book is so boring, it's hard to get there. I don't believe Cornwell even wrote this book. It doesn't have her flow because of the constant profanities, like jarring bumps in the road, and sounds as if it is written by a younger person who is used to including constant profanities in their own language. If she has a good story, why can't she just put it together and make it a relaxing read? It makes me wonder, 'Who wrote this?'",2
"As a long-time mystery and Scarpetta/Cornwell fan, I bought Black Notice for entertainment. I wasn't prepared to be a captive voyeur to Scarpetta's angst and to wonder between the lines how much was projected from Cornwell's own psyche. The axiom is that successful writers write about what they know best. I wish she had stayed with fiction",2
"Very disappointing, unlike her other books, we spend the whole book in Kay's mind, who is the Diva here? I'm not interested in finding out that Kay is beautiful or has beautiful breasts, it's the autopsys and the mystery I miss. Plus, several unanswered questions, Why was the body put in the container? among others.",2
"After reading 250 pages or so I was thinking to myself, ""this is really slow. Everything I've read so far could be summed up in a paragraph or two."" I was expecting something really exciting to happen but as I got to within a few pages of the end I realized I had been let down. It seemed P.C. wanted to end the book in a hurry and just let it go. I prefer Jeffrey Deaver's books. You know with his books you're in for a surprise.",2
"This is the first time a have read a Cornwell novel. I hope my first time reading her is my worst experience with her novels because I will soon embark on reading three more of her novels.The sub-plots in this work, if they can even be considered sub-plots, add virtually nothing to the story line. And the addition of segments about Ms Scarpettas dead former lover, also add absolutely nothing more than adding pages. In reality these are all put in to thicken the book. If Ms Cornwell were to be honest with us, she woud admit that this ""novel"" could have been easily reduced to a short story.The ending is extremely disappointing. We learn nothing of what makes the killer tick. I would suggest that you selct any other novel to read. Don't waste your time on this one. Come to think of it, I should have rated this book as one star.",2
"I have read almost all of Cornwall's book's and found this one to not be very exciting. The depressing mood and the lack of any exciting events made me want to stop reading it several times. However, I finished it only to be extremely irritated by the ending. Maybe the next one will be back to Cornwall's usual standards.",2
"As an avid Scarpetta reader, I was disappointed with Black Notice. There were too many subplots with the characters, and I found that the main plot of the book (i.e., trailing the ""werewolf"") was virtually put aside until the midpoint of the book. The climax of the book was anticlimatic, and ill-contrived. Please bring back the strong, tough Scarpetta that we all love!",2
"I was pretty disappointed with this novel especially since it was so anticipated. I felt that Kay was very whiney, Lucy is going out of control and Marino is just unbelievable. I also did not get even a tiny thrill of fear throughout the entire book. I hope her next book is more along the lines of the classic Kay Scarpetta that I have come to enjoy.",2
"What starts out as a reasonably intriguing mystery spins out of control over the final hundred pages or so, into a ridiculous ending. Lucy (AKA supergirl) & her new gal G.I. Jo are trying to shut down a gun-smuggling operation down in Florida & somehow it's all connected to the case back in VA. Isn't that amazing... Then we have Scarpetta and Marino flying off to Paris to meet w/ an Interpol agent & only Scarpetta can help Interpol solve their case. Naturally the VA case is related to these cases in France. Oh I particularly love the afternoon randevÃº w/ a man almost 1/2 her age while in Paris (NOT).Glad I got the book from the local library.",2
"I've always loved the Scarpetta books, but if this had been the first one I wouldn't have read more. It's not just that the personal interaction seems to take precedence over the actual crime, or that the mood is horribly dark. It's that none of the plots in this are very well developed. Although there's a lot of time spent on the plot against Kay and her friend Marino, the motivation behind the plot wasn't very believable, at least to me. The introduction of Kay's new boyfriend gave that part of the book the tone of a bodice-ripper starring Fabio. And even the crime itself was easily solved with tips from the Kay's French counterpart - almost a deus ex machina solution. I will try to avoid reading Cornwell's next book.",2
"I have read everything Patricia Cornwell has written. This starts out very intriguing and leads up to a wonderful climax and then falls ""flat"". More of a wham-bam-no-thank-you ending. In comparison with her previous writings, this books falls very shot of her wonderful skill. It does not show here. Kay Scarpetta is mean and cold. Lucy has turned into some hard-core maniac and the reasoning is NOT believeable. It is time to let go of personal anger and bring back the characters that she is capable of writing about. Very disappointed, but will keep trying her again.",2
"ms cornwell's stories are interesting, but lately dr scarpetta has become the most whinny, self centered character to hit the literary pages in some time. as for the ending it seemed (and not for the first time) that ms cornewll got tired of writing and just hurried the ending and left me at least wanting more or at least some answeres to the questions she posed in the book. overall another disappointment in the series.",2
"Apparently Patricia Cornwell has never met a character she actually liked. Even her protagonists are irrasible and paranoid to the point that they can't get along with each other for more than five minutes without blowing up, storming out or otherwise behaving like emotionally stunted two-year-olds. It's unusual to enjoy a mystery and its solution without experiencing the slightest affinity for the people involved, but that's the way I feel reading Cornwell's books. Given the choice of hanging out with the good doctor, Superniece, and their friends or the unfortunate victims in the morgue, I'd choose the latter; at least they know how to stay calm and cool under pressure.",2
"I love the Kay Scarpetta novels, and have read all of them. The last few (this one included) seem to be reaching for storylines. There's always a ""bad guy"", other than the murderer the heroine is after. Someone within Scarpetta's office or within the police department who's out to get her. And all of these ""bad guys"" are so jealous of the world-famous Dr. Scarpetta. Come on! These story lines have little or nothing to do with the main theme of the book and really detract from the story. I, for one, preferred the earlier Scarpetta novels.",2
"Unfortunately I didn't happen to read the reviews of this book before reading it, otherwise I might have thought twice about it. This was my first disappointment with one of Patricia Cornwell's books. I probably would have read the book regardless, since I like the character. Unfortunately, however, I will now wait and read the reviews of the next book before I spend my time on it. Most of the book was as an enjoyable read, however I was extremely disappointed in the ending of the book. The end seemed completely out of character for Dr. Scarpetta and totally unbelievable. My first thought was that it was a rush job in order to get it to press. Actually, I'm hoping that is the case as there didn't seem to be much thought or originality in the finale. If this is a sign of things to come, then I'll regretfully have to pass on the future books.",2
"THis product looked nothing like the picture. It was very small and did not sparkle. I had to purchase other earrings, instead.",2
"Have you ever tried to like a recording but finally have to just give up and admit you don't? It's hard to put my finger on exactly what I don't like: there is a freewheeling energy derived from a mix of rock, blue grass, and Zydeco. The songs are generally up-tempo and the band, if not always tight, is spirited.But after one last listen, the more I realize I'll never play this CD again. I don't have a high tolerance for fiddle or zydeco to begin with, so what others might dub infectious, I find irritating, especially when the fiddle is sawing away and the band seems to be going through the motions.Something seems wrong here,like drinking stout in the sun. At best one might get away with slipping a track or two on a compilation CD.",2
"small opening in the eyepiece makes the use of this counterproductive, as your eye needs to actually get closer to the piece. If you wear eyeglasses, like I do, forgeddaboutit!",2
"First off the photo listed here on amazon is not accurate of product. I went back and forth on whether or not I liked the adapter/magnifier. Ultimately I don't use it anymore, you lose a small percentage of the view finder with the adapter on it, and considering that most dSLRs (i use d200) are 95% of the actual sensor/image area to begin with, losing another 5% is not how I want to be shooting.",2
"I noticed that the book lost interest and flow after a couple of chapters. To be honest, the last chapter was so boring that I did not even finish it. I enjoyed the first 5 chapters, though.I guess it was very clear to me how everyting was tied together, exept for a couple of chapters.",2
"Very disappointing book. The story never resolves with the introductory chapter, which seemed to be the most logical and interesting step to take. It's nothing but a collection of flat short stories, each predictable and hurried. Only one or twice did I care what happened to anyone, as the writing style rushed along -- I understood that the painting was supposed to be the ""main character,"" but I found myself not empathizing with why the human characters would risk so much for this object. I suspect that the movie ""The Red Violin"" did a better job accomplishing what this author set out to do.",2
"Perhaps I wanted to find some of the delight I feel when I look at a Vermeer painting or reproduction of one. But instead I found a technically accomplished work which overall relentlessly focussed on the 'brutal facts of life', which has so little to do with the qualities of love, beauty, light and mysterious intimacy which I find in Vermeer's work. A depressing and disappointing read.",2
"Though built upon a promising premise, this collection of short tales woven around a single ""lost"" Vermeer painting gets off to an objectionable start that I found difficult to get over. The suggestion hinted at by the ending of the first story, that somehow the painting itself should be destroyed because it had once been stolen by a Nazi, is unconscionable. A work of art acquires no inherent guilt through the actions of those who handle it; the suggestion is all the more inappropriate given the Nazis' own penchant for destroying art.Otherwise, most of the stories in the book were originally written and published separately, and this perhaps accounts for their somewhat uneven execution. I found the two middle stories, ""Morningshine"" and ""From the Personal Papers of Adriaan Kuypers"" to be the most compelling tales in the book, each more for the personal stories they tell than any protagonism of the painting itself.",2
"Not much of a book but maybe entertaining for those who want a book for the beach. Tracy Chevalier's book, The Girl With the Pearl Earring, is a much more engaging treatment of the same topic (Vermeer.)",2
"I found the first half of this book to be fairly monotonous. While the concept for the novel--following a painting's owners all the way back to the painter--is interesting, Vreeland didn't really get me hooked in the first hundred pages. The stories got more interesting toward the end, but if I were a less voracious reader I might not have made it there.",2
"I just couldn't get started on this one. The first chapters were intriguing, but as the narrative went backwards, I couldn't quite keep my interest. I've read ""backwards"" books before, so I'm not sure why this one didn't grab me. I still wonder about whether or not it was real (I think it was...) but didn't wonder enough to finish the book!",2
"I'm on my second one of these, because the click-tab on the first one broke. It's not more than a month later, and this one has broken the same way. Six dollars may not be much money, but it should buy me a higher quality product than this. And I can't get the clip separately from the holster. If I could get them separately, I would just buy ten of the clips at two bucks a pop, because it isn't the holster that keeps breaking!",2
"Although it works well for a phone holster, and I still use it today, mine broke just a few months after purchase. Poor quality, but it gets the job done.",2
These valve cover bolts are a really nice design but I bought this set to match a 5 inch set that I have and these are advertised to be 5 inches long when in fact they are only 4 inches long and do not match my 5 inch bolts. I had to return them and I am still searching for the 5 inch ones to match the ones I have.,2
"I just finished watching this DVD. I can only compare my present stateto that of one who has been locked in a room full of crying, indecisive womenfor four hours and forced to eat a ten pound bag of sugar before he could leave.",2
"One of the least imaginative blues CDs I'd heard in a long long time. And from one of the alleged blues harp ""masters."" Please. If you're looking for great harp, stick with Carey Bell, Kim Wilson, Rod Piazza, Charlie Musselwhite, Sugar Blue, Paul de Lay or James Harman. Billy lives in Chicago and seemingly has hogged up the lion's share of studio work there over the past decade or more. For the life of me, I don't know why that is. Connections, I suppose. At any rate, maybe his other efforts are more vital but this one is to Chicago blues harp CDs what frozen pizza is to Chicago deep-dish pie.",2
"I am disappointed w / this DVD, the movie was shortened on this version. Having seen the original movie twice before, this alteration was quite obivious. Won't purchase this type of item in the future, how will you know you are getting the complete film or not?",2
"This film follows the unhappy life of doctor and poet Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and his doomed love affair with the beautiful Lara (Julie Christie) during the years of the Russian Revolution. Although technically brilliant, the story is a romantic muddle full of coincidence and unexplained changes in character. Sharif and Christie generate little chemistry on the screen. Sharif's portrayal is bland and the character of Zhivago is unsympathetic; his treatment of his unbelievably saintly first wife (Geraldine Chaplin) is unforgivable. Rod Steiger's Komarovsky goes from villainous cretin to would-be benefactor with little rationale.As I mentioned above, the production values are excellent and director David Lean certainly knows how to frame a shot. If the film were shorter, these merits would elevate it to three stars in my eyes. However, such expense, effort and time wasted on such threadbare material simply emphasizes how lightweight the story is.",2
It's unfortunate that such a grand effort ended in such a convoluted mess. Amazing sets and costumes will only carry you so far. I'm amazed that this movie is so highly regarded. Purchase at your own risk. Just be prepared to be bored and/or irritated.,2
"Hammy acting all-around, a repetetive score, unlikeable characters (especially the protagonists) all wrapped in widescreen eye candy scenery. An airy bon bon disguised as amomentous drama.",2
"I bought this DVD two weeks ago in Amazon, but unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. First, I realized it was made in Mexico, and the disc quality was very bad, too fragile, and it seems like it was a pirate copy because everything, including the print in the DVD seems fake.Next, the quality of the movie was bad also, when I saw this movie in cable TV a few months ago, I thought the quality of the movie was very good, but in this DVD is very bad; it has bad resolution.Finally, in the characteristics of the product, it says it was in English with subtitles in Spanish and English, but that is not true. It comes in English, French, and Spanish with subtitles in the same languages.Now I understand why the price was lowered. Definitively, I would take more care, when I buy something at Amazon.",2
I have loved Dr. Zhivago from the moment it hit the big screen but this DVD copy is of poor quality. It is cheaply produced and you discover that the movie is on both sides of the DVD. It is just disappointing. The lesson is that often when you buy cheap you get a substandard product...lesson learned. I'm going to find an old VHS copy to watch.,2
"If you are a man, start running now! Although this movie is so slow that you could probably slither on your belly and still escape it.If you are a woman you may be able to sit through this seemingly unending saga of Soviet slush. But you better have plenty of patience. A good test might be to see ""Dances with Wolves"" first. If you can watch that without wishing that 90 minutes had been left on the cutting room floor, you MIGHT have the grit for Zhivago.I gave it 2 stars on the assumption that somewhere out there exists a movie which is even more torturous than this one.",2
"The reason this version of this wonderful film only merits two stars from me is due to the multiple jumps and freezes on the discs. Yes, that's plural. The second DVD I ordered to replace the first one also had the same problems but in different places on the disc. Don't know what's going on here, but the quality control for this edition is horrible. David Lean would be scandalized that his epic film is being so shoddily reproduced. I've now had to return this second DVD and am asking for a refund this time. I mean, what are the odds that the third one I'd get would also be defective? I'm going to try the two-disc set, see if it's got the same problems. Very annoying and totally unnecessary to have to jump through these hoops in 2011 to get a decently produced DVD.",2
"If you're the kind of person who loves the TV show, you will be the kind of person who hates this god awful movie.",2
"On it's own, this movie is OK. It is certainly not a great movie, but if you are up late or bored, it might be enjoyable. However, if you are a fan of the show, as I am, then this movie provides little drug for your ""Buffy"" fix and fails to provide any significant history to a fan of the show. Also, don't watch the movie and expect to see the same level of drama/comedy/romance and depth of the characters as you see on television each week. If you are a fan of the tv show, watch/buy the series premiere ""Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest"" as a starting point. Finally, while I like Kristy Swanson, she is no Sarah Michelle Geller who is the ""real"" Buffy (despite not being the original).",2
"Well I thought that the Movie was a bit on the cheesy side, nothing like the series at all! Series was the BEST!",2
"I've never been a great fan of teen comedies and this is no exception. I find it hard to believe the highly acclaimed TV series came from this daft film. Kristy Swanson sure is cute although perhaps as irritating as Sarah Michelle Gellar!?Anyway, this movie may prove TOO camp for fans of the series. I was hoping this would be better, but the vamps are just idiotic and the whole thing becomes rather tiresome.I suppose I could recommend it to fans of the series, but I'll bet you'll shun it, and I wouldn't blame you.",2
"Largely a waste of time unless you really, really want to see the prototype for the superior TV Buffy.Unexceptional picture and sound.",2
This is a ok movie it is not as good as the show. The acctress Kristie Swanson is a ok acctress but Sharah Michelle Geller is a better buffy.,2
This movie isn't the greatest. So many things were wrong.1. The birth mark (It was big and nasty)2. Flying Vamps (Stupid)3. Vamps don't dust (There would be to many bodies)4. Vamps didnt change their face (Human faces w/ weird eyes & big teeth)5. Slayer Cramps (Stupid to have cramps as a reminder about vamps near by)Just a few examples. I know this was back in '92 but it still could have been better.The T.V series however is the best! The movie is not important to the show so dont even give it a chance.,2
"I got this movie cause I saw the TV show and I wanted to see what the movie was like. This movie is not that great and if it were not for the TV series, it would probably fall off the face of the planet. Do yourself a favor and just try to rent it from somewhere.",2
"Anyone who is a fan of Buffy the show, knows that it's superior to the movie in all aspects. Poor Joss Whedon probably wrote a great script about a young blonde highschool cheerleader who would ready to kick the butt of any vampire who cornered her in a dark ally. Because of this gift, the responsibility of saving the world would be overwhelming and she would long for a normal life and realize what can really be important. Unfortunatly, even though glimpes of Joss's intentions can be seen in the script, the intention was butchered like an Enron document through a shredder. Still, if you like campy vampire movies, you may love this. But watch the show and you will see the astounding difference.",2
"I first saw this movie when I was 10 or so at a birthday party and loved it! Now 5 years later I went out and bought it, since it was on sale (I would find out why later) and sat down with a couple of friends and got ready for some fun. Well the first thing we both saw was how horrible the dialouge was, the teenage 'slang' is exaggerated as our their actions. Even worse were the jokes, due in part to Kristy Swansons acting. The filming didn't do much justice to it either and the vampires were the most humorous villans I've ever seen.It only gets 2 stars because of the awesome show that would be made out of it later.",2
"I've seen the movie in Italian, few years ago. It was nice and funny. Not much coherent, but ... who cares?I cannot say I love this movie, but sometime I like watch it and some of the jokes are great!",2
"This movie is a must have for any BTVS hardcore fan. If you're not then don't bother. This is the movie that started the greatest series on tv. And the creator of that show made this movie. However, being a huge disappointment to me, a huge buffy show fan, i only recommend buying this movie if you are totally devoted to the series. none of the actors in the movie are in the show. there is a whole new cast, but not creator and director, which is excellent, since the idea and direction were good, the acting and writing however, needs a little work. Pee Wee Herman stars and so does Luke Perry, which anyone can see is why the acting is bad. David Arquette also stars, also bad actor. Despite is badness, it is a great way to learn pre-series trivia and such.",2
okay even thou i love the tv show I will try not to compare thenm to much.the movies was supposed to be silly and light. swason is all right as buffy all she is not the right age to play a 16 year old girl.i liked the donald sutherland as her watcher all he no giles. it was sad when he died. i cnat stand luke perry he is what keeps the from getting a higher review.,2

i'd like to say that this movie isn't so good.....it made me laugh but there are no horror scenes...and the cast isn't allright.in fact buffy isn't so good as the one performed by sarah michelle gellar. luke perry is awful and the only thing i liked is cassandra's death. watch it but i don't think u'll go buying it...,2
"If they would have done a lot less flip-flopping, and had been a little mature it could have been a great movie, but with all their antics I soon lost intrest.",2
"This mystery is very weak, with historical misinformation thrown in to make the premise blievable. Though about where to find a long lost Rooselvelt-Hitler letter at the begging, it quickly turns into who is stealing lobsters from ocean traps. The majority of the novel revolves around this lobster mystery. To bolster hisory, the author shows his ignorance by incorrectly bringing in two (2) historical inaccuracies: Radio Free Europe was founded in 1949 with a first broadcast on 4 July 1950 to Czechoslovakia, not 1945 as he says; Joseph Goebbels was never in the military because of his club foot, therefore he was not a General as the author says. He was the Propagamda Minister for the Third Reich (and a very good one.) My biggest complaint is the very short chapters (mostly 2--3 pages, which comes out to 80 chapters for 229 pages!) I believe this author needs to take college creative writing courses.",2
"I bought this to make a few necklaces with. Well, the quality is far from great.I wanted to test it before giving people crap, so the day it came I grabbed two sides and yanked - lightly. It snapped like a twig. Tried it again but lighter. Snapped again.If you buy it, it will break if caught on something. It's very cheap, very crappy. Pretty, but I'd never buy again. I actually just threw it out because I refuse to give people crap, and it seems like that's what this is.",2
there is no way of spilting the tablet in half..it is too big and thick..have to use a pill cutter....before they redid the tablet you can spilt it in half with your fingers...customer service at hartz was very indifferent and seem like they didnt care...........bad customer service and offer no remedy to the situation.....,2
"I'm giving this product 2 stars because Eforcity shipped quickly and when I emailed them about the inability of the battery to hold a charge for very long they quickly shipped a replacement free of charge. Good customer service. Unfortunately, the second battery exhibits the same behavior, holding a charge---with extremely light phone use---for about half the time the original Motorola battery did. So I strongly suspect these are not real Motorola batteries, or they are simply too old to work properly.",2
"Being a big fan of the Ballykissangel series, I own and have watched all the previous. And unfortunately each series has gotten progessively more disappointing with this one actually not watchable. Its slow, boring, and has officailly Jumped the Shark. I'd pass this over and stick to the first three in the series.",2
I did not enjoy season 5 anywhere near as much as I had the previous seasons. Donnal and Liam were becoming more and more annoying and they seemed to take up a larger part of each program. I also cringed every time Uncle Minto made an appearance. Where did they get him?I knew that many of the characters were just going to disappear without any kind of acknowledgement at the end of the season 5 and figured that it would best to stop watching at that point rather than be further disappointed with season 6. I was wrong. Season 6 is wonderful and you just have to get through season 5.,2
I found after reading it for awhile that I had no interest in even finishing the book. I got very bored and quite after reading more than half.,2
I got the Kindle Edition for 99 cents. It is almost worth it. It may be okay for reading straight through but not for study. For that you need a table of contents and a good index.,2
"It does not read well, as it is a list of items to be further researched and validated with study.And, while the content is intriguing and worth study, the kindle version is nearly worthless.* The kindle edition does not render Hebrew correctly (it's a jumble of characters & letters), though greek seems to come through, usually.* The 'tables' do not align when presented.* There are no breaks, chapters, etc to make navigation easy and this edition as a worthwhile reference.",2
An ebook like this does need to have links from to content to reference the numbers in this case. I own a printed copy of this book and hoped to use the ebook version.,2
"A wonderful movie overall, but the subtitles are terrible and distract from enjoyment of the film.The letters are too big, and often only four or five words are fitted per line, so an additional line of subtitles is necessary, taking up the bottom 25 to 30% of the screen. Can't see the movie for the words! The same holds true for the sequels.I'd buy another copy if only they'd fix this aweful production flaw.DON'T BUY IT! Wait for an improved edition! Too high a cost for such a faulty product.",2
"In case you didn't get the message from the last few reviews: do NOT buy this DVD unless you have no other option for seeing this film and can't wait for a better release to come along. The subtitles are so bad as to make certain scenes incomprehensible; the audio transfer is terrible (the characters sound like they're in a tin box, the vocal track is out of sync, etc.); and the print is faded and it looks like no attempt was made to clean it up in digital transfer. Nevertheless, the film is a blast, and you don't really need to understand the dialogue to follow the plot. To quote from the subtitles, you don't ""loose"" much and you won't feel ""dump"" if you can't understand exactly what's being said.",2
"While I enjoyed the first novel in this series, I thought this second novel was not up to par. The characters were not particularly deep or engaging and I was not sure why Beatrix Potter was in the plot. I was not drawn into the characters' world as I had expected to be based on the first novel and probably will not pick up the next novel in the series. It seems to me that the author(s) were aiming at a much younger audience than grown women.",2
"This/these are beyond lame! The new season is all about Earl in prison. No karma nonsense, just half baked episodes about ...prison?!?!Thank god for Jason Lee or this would really blow!",2
"While the first two seasons were very successful, the third season is awful. THe idea of changing the format slightly is understandable and the creators were probably aftaid of getting in a rut. The problem is that the show was really very good. Until, at first Earls goes to prison, during which time he stops crossing things off his list and then he goes into a coma and it gets worse, a lot worse. Also, while previously the storylines were funny now the want to shock also slightly and the whole concept does not work anymore really.",2
"The season broke with the formula and ended up suffering for it...but there are still some pretty good moments.Main complaint is the SHOCKING lack of special features on the DVD. NO COMMENTARIES = NOT WORTH IT. I'd only buy it if you need to catch up on the series, if you're a collector, or if you don't care about special features.",2
"After firing Ross Valory and Steve Smith, Steve Perry produced what essentially sounded like a Steve Perry solo album. If you love 80s cheesy synths and robotic percussion then this is for you. If however, you were a fan from the pre-Perry days, this represented the complete demise of the original spirit of the band. Although this record leans toward R&B, Perry, stadium rock god that he was, was no Sam Cooke and the music lacks authenticity. ""Be Good to Yourself"" reminds of past glories, but ""Suzanne"" is painful and plastic.",2

"It's very interesting, in that the major roles, with one exception, are female. Having a female play a sex-changed male is unusual too. I would have enjoyed knowing why the translator was alienated from her mother. I did enjoy the movie. It was refreshing to have a mystery in which no one was in serious danger.",2
"Judy Davis is very good, but I lost interest in the story and the other characters about halfway through, but I did see the rest, thanks to Judy Davis. My wife and I both thought the whole thing was just so-so. Saw it on TV, and have now erased it.",2
"I made the mistake buying this album after listening to ""Never Seen Before"" off the Def Jam's How to Be a Player Soundtrack. Never have I heard such repetitive beats. And the lyrics? Check it: ""Who want it?/Come and see me like 112/And I'll rock the bell with Fox and L"", said Erick in ""Da Joint"". Wack rhymes like this suggest that Erick and Parrish got back together only to make dollars and not good music. To tell you the truth, they remind me of an old-school Big Tymers. If you wanna peep their REAL skills, buy every album they made before this one.",2
"Please-some one needs to teach the ""rappers"" how to rap. They say nothing in the whole CD that makes sense or is worth listening to. Beats are alright. Bottem line- don't do what I did, save your $13.",2
"Overall proably one of the worst books ive ever read in my entire life. No wonder why so many people suffer from Depression. This is half the battle. Terrible advice (such as eating chocalate and being happy). I respect the fact that it does break some stuff down, but it again doesnt answer many vital questions that a depressed person would like to know.There were a few good sentences in this book. But a lot of it didnt get emphaised well. Once again, it seems to be another book that has been corrupted on these topics.",2
"Finally, the Dante project of Edgar Froese has come to an end. Paradiso is the final set of disks to this project and I would not call it a Tangerine Dream album. It is an Edgar Froese album, pure and simple. Jerome is not on the disk and he is SORELY missing. This album lasts an eternity and rarely has any spark, fire, or energetic emotion. I can see why Jerome wanted no part to this debacle. He did not appear at any of the performances of Paradiso.There are a couple of good tracks on Paradiso but the incredible lenghth of this album (2+ hours!) will mean that it hardly ever gets listened to.The synths that are so characteristic of Tangerine Dream are virtually absent as there is an orchestra that are the main performers. I really would not have guess that this was Tangerine Dream had I not known in advance.Hopefully, they can recover from this and regroup with Jerome to produce something better.",2
"Very lame ""scary"" teen movie. However, if you are a James McAvoy fan what the Heck..",2
"I love slasher films and will forever love slasher films, but there are some that you want to remember a little more than others. My case in point ""sleepaway camp "" classic and gets better more times you watch it but ""the pool"" on the other hand of which this is true not the worst of the slasher genre but far from the best in the crop of so many horror titles having a mask wearing pyscho.The acting not all that bad but the plot drags so much you find yourself wanting to fast forward to when the good stuff starts.This feels like any movie you have seen a 100 times before it's way to predictable and the character development is terrible even for a slasher film .It does have one memorable killing on the covered water slide but other then that not much going on here that has not been done to death and fails miserably!If this would have taken place at a public pool not even the lifeguard would have wanted to save this dud of a slasher!",2
"This is the typical B grade slasher pic that rips off Friday The 13th. It's basicly putting Jason Voorhees (A guy in a mask with a machette knife) into a situation where he can slaughter a bunch of college grads who have broken into a rec centre for the graduation party.The acting is mostly terrible, the scares are stupid, the horror is not there, and the chill factor is in the minus 10 area. About the only kill in the movie that was any good was one of the kids coming down a water slide...but it didnt show anything memorable for the effect to work to its maximum potentiol.Ya might wanna rent it to laugh at how bad it is, but otherwise, dont bother with it, you're not missing anything special.",2
"If I had friends and family like Min, I would have told them where to go long ago. I found it hard to believe that a 33 yr. old female put up with so much from them.I usually love most of Crusie's books but this was not a favorite. I didn't like most of the characters and thought they were nuts.",2
"I started the book thinking it would be a great escape from reality. Well, it was and it wasn't. It seemed as though the author was trying to write both Bridget Jones's Diary and Sex and the City...but she didn't quite pull off either. Don't get me wrong, it was a somewhat enjoyable fantasy book, however, I am not going to suggest it to any of my friends.",2
"This book is so lame. I bought the Kindle version out of the rave review and the cheap price, but I couldn't believe I was reading a crap like this. It's full of cliche and unrealistic plots and characters. I love reading romance and enjoy watching romantic comedy movie, so I understand it can sometimes consist some coincidences and events just to add that romantic spice. And I think this book has a good potential to go on a movie if it were not so ridiculous and stupid. The characters are one dimensional and the entire story is surrounded with a silly bet, which is alright if the author can develop more depth on her story. The lines just keep jumping from Cal and Min and their silly friends, with coincidences and trashy comments. I gave it two stars for its sometimes funny lines, but other than that this book is totally waste of time. I would have gone for Sophia Kinsella over this.",2
"I know I am a very small minority here, but I did not like this book. I found the characters to be flat and boring.Min's food fetish was annoying and, I must say, somewhat offensive. Why is it that the character without the perfect body is obsessed with food and has low self esteem? Is it not possible for a chubby woman to have interests that do not involve taste.Other than the job, which was purely background, Min did nt have a whole lot going for her. Did she travel? What kind of books did she read? Did she have any interests at all? I think her friend was right in saying that she brought nothing to the relationship with Cal.Cal was o.k., though he suffered a similar lack of character development. We know that he is gorgeous and likes to hit and run, but what else has he got?The writer did not show enough of either character to get me truly invested.I do not regret reading this book, but it was my first and last by this author.",2
"This was an engaging, light read. Crusie is good at writing snappy dialogue, but I could not get past her choice to give her 2 leading characters the very old-fashioned names- Minerva and Calvin! I kept imagining my grandparents, which frankly is not a picture you want in your head when you're reading a romance novel!",2
The story started off ok but it didn't take long for me to wish it would hurry up and be over. Just could not get committed to the story or the characters.,2
Very poor fit. I had to go to the hardware store to make my own mounting bolt that would work. Not worth it. Stay with the stock foam one.,2
"Whomever is writing these stories is like a Twinkie manufacturer that produces a lot of nutritional fluff that is slightly filling to start out with but just as you get to the heart of the confectionary you find they left out the filling - it's just air. So these stories start out seemingly to fill you but when you get to the end, it just deflates like an empty Twinkie balloon. The writers do not know how to create a drama with a memorable, rather than forgettable finish. Each episode had a predictable, bland uncreative closure to it's plot.Two stars only because the acting and character portrayal, even though unrealistically off-the-wall, ends up holding the stories together. In particular, the dialogue portion of the script was typical British sarcastically spot on. As an aside, I miss the secretary officer, PC Clark after this first year because he portrayed the only rational, sensible police official.",2
"The worst record I have heard this year. The guy I bought it from sold it because he couldn't stand it. Even the Princeton Record Exchange won't take it.It's not even well-recorded. Or interesting ... even though it seems like it should be, what with Richard Stoltzman's clarinet interacting with percussion and all.",2
The photo does not match the product because of that I had to buy two stone guards instead of one which was what I really needed. Besides this mistake the product is OK and matched the original grills.,2
I seem to be good at picking poor movies from the past. Oh well don't know if you don't try.,2
"I've had three Mighty Mouses for my iMac, and after this last one, I decided no more. They all work just fine until they get dirty and quit working. Apple, in their infinite wisdom and greed, made these so that they can't be cleaned without breaking into them and dealing with the incredibly intricate interior components, and then putting them back together with Super Glue. So when it happened this last time, I just went out to OfficeMax and bought a wired Logitech m110 for $17.11 (incl tax). It works just fine, plus is hugely cost effective, considering what Apple charges for their Mighty Mouse. This is the first time since 1984 that I've encountered an Apple product that sucks--I hope this isn't a trend.",2
"It's nice to see Apple finally moving toward two-button mice, but this just isn't the answer. Maybe it is just my hands, but I find it impossibly hard to separate the left and right mouse button. More often than not I am right-clicking when I try to left-. It practice it means I keep doing stupid stuff like removing elements from the Safari toolbar when all I want to do is click.Mine is now collecting dust in favor of a traditional two-button mouse.I do, however, really miss the scroll ball. I know many do not, but for me a normal wheel seems hamstrung once you've used the ball on the mighty mouse.",2
"The scroll ball is a good idea, and I enjoyed it while it lasted, but mine isn't working anymore after just 1 month. Otherwise, the mouse is ergonomically awkward, feeling more like a plastic potato rather than a computer device. The side buttons are touchy and can be accidentally triggered when moving the mouse. The mouse lacks a defined left and right button too, leaving you to control-click to get contextual menus.Here's a tip -- get a better designed, 2 button mouse with a scroll-wheel. If you need to scroll horizontally, press SHIFT on the keyboard, then use the scroll wheel. If it's all configured correctly, you can scroll horozontally through the window. Apple markets this mouse as the only one that lets you scroll horizontally, but this is not the case.",2
"Hey, I feel this is like a BIG step back. I had already got used to a wireless mouse and then we have to go back to a corded one?Thanks but no thanks, It is so simple to make a wireless mouse that I have no doubt Apple (being so innovative???) should come up with one VERY soon... THEN I'll buy one! Meanwhile I'll continue to use my old Microsoft Intelli Mouse.Now I'm a little dissapointed.",2
"The product review claims, ""...detect where you're clicking, transforming your sleek, one-button mouse into a two-button wonder."" To use the right hand click on this mouse, one must remove the left part of your hand from the mouse or it will register as a normal click. This is extremely inconvenient. Next time Apple should try to make a true two button mouse or change the logic of their software. I shouldn't have to change how I use my mouse to accommodate a product with a UI flaw.-Opinion from a new mac user",2
"I'm a big mac user, usually love their products, but I gotta say . . . this mouse has turned out to be a disappointment. Two reasons:1. The right-click/left-click technology has never worked.2. The scroller just stopped working today . . . after owning it for only a matter of months. I can no longer stroll down, just up and side-to-side.I've just ordered a new mouse.",2
"I was excited about my Mighty Mouse, because I do a lot of horizontal scrolling.Downsides:The short cord (VERY short -- get an extension if you don't have a laptop) is a bit of a bummer, and the left/right click recognition is a bit messed up, and the side buttons are basically useless (I am unable to get my fingers into a comfortable position to use them)...Upside:That said, I still liked it. I like the programmable scroll button and the feel and size of the mouse. I like the quiet whirring the scroll ball makes when I spin it.Ultimate downside:So why 2 stars? Well, maybe mine's a fluke, but after two weeks of standard business use, my scroll ball has stopped working. I consider that unacceptable and it makes me think seriously about returning (not exchanging!) the product.",2
Pretty good mouse at first.We use this on a family computer that gets lots of use. The scroll ball is constantly out of order and it is just plain annoying to be dealing with fixing it all of the time.This seems like form over function problem.,2
"I'm on my third Mighty Mouse in 3 years. At $50 a pop, I expect them to last longer! Inevitably, after about a year or so, the trackball stops scrolling in one direction or another. I tried cleaning it with compressed air, but no luck. I always admire the MM's functions for 12 or so months, and then BAM! It chokes.",2
"Good Mouse until they break. 9 months and then the scroll ball died. Same thing happened to a friend. Poorly made, and Apple only gives a 90 day warranty. Not happy for $60.",2
"This movie is one Big mistake. It's at least twice as long as it should be (You just spend ten minutes listening two the opening music, before anything happens. I first thought it was some sort of mistake. When the story finally gets started you just wish you were back with the music.) The sentimentalism and the corny-ness of the plot defie all imagination. It reminds me of the Christmas tales my teachers used two read for a bunch of five-year olads and even then I was bored out of my skull. To enliven it the hero-villain relationship borders n the homsexual, but even that goes precisely nowhere.In the whole movie there are only two parts that bear watching: The sea-battle and the chariot-race. For the rest, forget about it. There are a lot of actors, who try, but there just is no way to make this movie interesting. If they scale it down to 100 minutes that would be an improvement. It shouldn't be too difficult. After all, the rest isn't worth watching anyway.",2
"This must be one of the most boring movies ever. Personally I could bearly keep my eyes open. Instead of the movie keeping the pace, I kept it myself, with a little help of the fastforward button. Charlton Heston is at his most narsistic. The story is so sentimental, that it is almost worse than the book. The only things worth watching are the chariotrace and Stephen Boyd as Messala. The rest might as well not exist.",2
The DVD is not working .. it was fine through about 30 minutes of the MOVIE. The physical apperence was as perfect as any I have seen. BUT somehow the DVD skips 2 parts of the frames. i am trying to find the way to return and get a new one.,2
"I must start out that I have only been alive for some 20 years and have not have been privy to the evolution of movies. As an example, I wasn't all that impressed with Citizen Kane when compared to modern day movies. However, I can see how it was a pivotal piece of work that laid the foundation for other movies. This is exactly the same way that I feel about Ben-Hur. While the cinematography and acting are spectacular, the over drama becomes heavy handed when it doesn't advance the story. The whole romantic interest was thrown in to draw more people into the theaters. I feel that more time should have been focused on the actual plot. The movie ponders along and eventually comes back to the story in a lazy manner. If this movie were brought out today, then it would be seen as a valiant effort, but overproduced and bland. Overall, not bad, but not too good.",2
"Ok I got it. I got it after the first 3 stories. Unless you are studying the difference between male and female fantasy, I found the book boring.",2
"As a blogger who writes quirky and unconventional perspectives on LOVE, I am compelled to read what is moving the public. Anais Nin's Delta of Venus was definitely an improvement over Fifty Shades of Grey. However for me, erotica is not personally moving sans the romance. Nin herself writes that sex without love lacks color. Delta of Venus is a series of short sex stories. I stayed with it anticipating that one of the essays would capture my attention. Instead I was once again disappointed in reading about atypical sexual perversions void of emotion. More interesting is to consider how scandalous Delta of Venus was in the context of the tImes. Howard Roarke in the Fountainhead got me going more than the characters in 50 Shades of Grey and Delta of Venus. Back to writing on ILoveYouOften.com, an optimistic reality check on love and relationships and other good stuff!",2
This is the second of her books I have read. I will not purchase anymore. I found it rather boring as I did her first book. Unfortunately I purchased both books at the same time. I would not recommend. There are so many more ... books out there that are better.,2
"I guess I was expecting better writing from Nin. I have heard so many good things about her writing and I have read a few books by one of her ""good friends"", Henry Miller, that I decided to pick up Delta of Venus and was a bit disappointed. In the introduction Anais Nin describes the conditions under which she wrote much of what is contained in this book. Some wealthy ""collector"" had commissioned erotica at the rate of $1/page and he was not interested in anything but the physical act of sex. Well, Nin delivered. Much of the content is the description of various sexual situations and lacks what I would consider art. Reading Delta of Venus I felt like I was reading a more tasteful version of Letters to Penthouse. I must admit, this is my first exposure to Nin so I am not saying she is not a gifted author. I understand she was commissioned to write stories of this nature, I'm just saying I expected something more.",2
"Hmm - why is this book such a bore? Surely the appeal of erotica is in reading about things that cannot normally be discussed; ideas that would not normally be thinkable, behaviour that would not normally be permissable. So what does it say when none of the sad packs appearing in these short stories manage to bring forth any concepts which are novel, surprising or confronting? Incest, necrophilia, exhibitionism all get a look in, but in a way which is unappealing - the book seems to assume an audience with the traditional Western attributes of repressed sexuality, a belief that sex in sinful, and hatred of the human body. To answer my own question, the implicit assumptions that pleasure is evil, sexuality is sinful and that people are ugly, is what makes it a bore.",2
"Wordy, wordy, wordy. Lots of info there, somewhere -- like Ronald Reagan's story of horse poop in Xmas stocking: look for the pony, if you like. I couldn't, and I seldom put down a promising book.Negative stars to publisher McGraw-Hill, for failing to promote simple, declarative sentences, and to emphasize points through book design/layout.",2

"The product pictured has a battery door which is the 9120B, not the 9120 as labeled (and shipped to me). This model is hard wired like the 9120B, but is missing the battery backup. Without a battery backup the smoke detector will not work in case of a power loss.I'm not quite sure why thy make a model like this, but for me it is useless and now I have to ship back the product because Amazon did not appropriately represent the product.",2
"After reading all of the positive reviews, I bought 6 of these smoke alarms for my home. Installation was very quick and easy. My husband installed all 6 (according to the instructions) within an hour. It has been two weeks now, and EVERY DAY at random times during the day (3am, 4pm, 9am) for no reason at all, each smoke alarm BEEPS. The sound is piercing and has woken us up in the middle of the night on several occasions. We've read the instructions and even contacted the company about the erratic beeping and were told that it ""may happen from time to time."" Unfortunately, we threw out the boxes, so we cannot return the alarms to amazon. If anyone has sleeping children, I suggest you buy a different alarm.",2
"Petra, through the 70s and 80s, were always able to stay musically current and relevant, riding the wave of that era's musical trends. They stumbled badly when the decade of the 90s rolled around. In my mind, their last classic album was Beyond Belief, and though every album since has had its high points, none has been consistently great. Now comes Double Take, an album that tries to change their big arena rock sound into an acoustic, 90's vibe. For the most part, it doesn't work, and, at times, is even painful to listen to. Unfortunately, it sounds like Petra is determined to reinvent itself for each subsequent generation. After two decades of success, their chameleon act has run out of magic.",2
"It's one thing to go back and remake a song to improve it. But why take out a bunch of really awesome songs and try to see how far you can mutate them just for the fun of it, while destroying several good songs in the process (thank goodness I have the good versions on other albums). This album makes me wonder if the band has come to the end of their creative road and are simply fishing the bottom of the barrel to try to come up with something they can release just to get the label off their backs or to make a buck. I have loved Petra for two decades, but this, as far as I'm concerned, is not Petra.",2
"The trouble with recent Petra albums is trying to decide who they are by. Is it John Schlitt or is it Peta, and if the latter then who is in the band this week. Mr Schlitt seems to have taken on the mantle of destroying whatever was left of the intergrity of this once great band. This album is dire. No more, no less. With insipid and lifeless versions of previous Peta classics, it is an example of down far downhill they have gone wince the glory days of Unseen Power et al.With the recent 'firing' of their long serving drummer for no aparant reason, I'm afraid that the writing is on the wall. A sad epitaph. This album says it all really.",2
"The story is good and the screenplay has the right idea, but the low-grade technical aspects are terrible. The considerations one must make for this is too much. The movie on this DVD is primitive stuff! (too bad for South City) If Ronny Yu did it today with access to all the technical devices and support it would be worth the money.",2
"Now I'm a HUUUGE Bob Marley fan, and I have all his works. I'm also Jamaican and have a deep undertsanding and appreciation of Bob. I wished this release had only included Bob's family, his children, The I threes's , and the other Jamaican singers like Jimmy Cliff etc..Because it angers me that people like lauren hill starts associating her self with Bob's legacy, of which she has no part.Well of course Ziggy, and the rest of the Marley clan being as gracious as they are will not say anything. lauren hill can go find another famous roots celebrity to jock-ride.Go away. we dont like you! Go do your little poetry thing over in ny. Go find a different artist to jock ride.For that reason i'm giving this release 2 stars. Bob , Ziggy, Rita, Judy, Marcia and the rest of the Marley clan and Jimmy Cliff and the Jamaican singers all gets 5 stars however.Too bad hill had to force herself up into this production. it leaves one with a sour taste in their mouth.",2
These are far from my favorite. At first I thought they were ok and I didn't realize what great good tasting gluten Free cookies are out there to buy.,2
I enjoyed the reminders of the fifties but I couldn't get past her shallowness. When one of her friends starts to date a boy that is out of their circle she suggests that her friends class finally shows. She is an avid reader but seems so unconnected to anything that is going on in the world. I don't think she would have been someone that I would have been interested in when I grew up in the fifties. I thought it was a story going no where and had a hard time finishing it.,2
"I was replacing a 2 year old Timex Expedition that was giving up the ghost and I have to admit the new 4 button format used by this watch is beyond me. Toggling back and forth through the time zones, getting the date to display vs the time, etc. is much more complicated than it needs to be.Overall, it's a nice looking watch and has a great set of features, but late at night with jet lag and needing to catch a flight a 6 am, I start wonder if I set the alarm in the right time zone, among other things.Finally, I start to wonder if buying a $40 watch every couple of years is more economical than buying a $150 watch and having it last a lifetime. So back it goes to Wallmart.",2
"...otherwise I'd look like a fool. If I'd waited until it made the best seller list I'd have gotten a discount, and then I'd have given it one star.I knew Mnookin was in trouble when he said that Garciaparra's .371 average was the highest for a Red sox player since Ted Williams batted .388 in 1957. I looked <everywhere> for something that made Ted's .406 irrelevant to the comparison, but couldn't find it. In addition to several factual errors, Mnookin is an awkward writer and does not choose words carefully. Clement was ""ushered off the field"" the day he was hit in head with a line drive? Things like that drive me nuts.Boring, boring, boring book.Someone should refer him to Michael Holley for a How-To-Follow-A-Team-For-A-Year-And-Come-Out-With-A-Great-Book Primer.Don't waste your money.

I found that this candle did not leave much scent and also it burned so that alot on the top of the candles was wasted.,2
"I've had this model for maybe 15 years, so trust that it's durable. It's hard to load BBs down the BB sized hole though, unless like someone said you have three hands, and preferably one of those is the size of a gecko's. I love the heft of the gun and the sound it makes when cocking it. However the visible arcing of the exiting shot quickly disipates any illusion that you've blasted anything. When firing, the recoil of the spring jolts the gun - enough so that you'll likely use two hands on it if you're aiming at a small target. As for the lack of power, I hit a rabbit in the butt using this gun from about 12 feet away. It turned around and looked at me, still chewing a mouthful of my hostas. ""Hosta"" la vista baby - NOT!",2
"Interesting only because it was made by Europe's premier exploitation director, ""Kitty"" is tedious and has pretensions to being an expose of the Nazis. This film is nothing more than a forerunner of the Italian (...) genre that flourished briefly in the 1970's. As to the controversial and perverse elements - they are clumsily handled and pointless. You'll find more (...) readily available elsewhere and the horror of the Nazis is presented much more graphically and forcefully in movies by Speilberg and Polanski to name but two. If you're interested in a more thoughtful attempt at controversy from Italian directors with better artistic credentials, you might try ""Seeds of Evil"" and Pasolini's ""Salo: 100 Days of Sodom"".",2
This movie takes the original idea of The Balcony directed in 1963 by Joseph Strick. Salon Kitty is not a erotic drama. Is a bad copy of a great movie.,2
"I have just listened to SHANGRI-LA DEE DA and after the first listen I am very disappointed. The 13 tracks kinda sound the same and the production is poor. The songs are soft with no catchy riffs, the vocals are weak and the same throughout the disc, and the songs feel like they were hurried and not given the proper time to develop. Of the the 3 ""rockers"" Dumb Love is the only one that even begins to come close to the STP of old. If you are a rock fan like I am and want a great record like CORE dont get this cd but if you are into the more POP sounding music this is an ok disc. It does have some high points but it could have been better so it earns 2 stars at its best",2
"On the special edition of ""Thank You"" I enjoyed the music clips that were played over the DVD menus. I found out that the music came from this album so I gave it a listen and I'm none to happy to report that Stone Temple Pilots fans won't like this album.""Days of the Week"" is alright. It's a catchy song and it gets you pumped for another album by them but the rest of the album is terrible. The music clips which I refered to are just the introductions to the songs which change after the first seven seconds into empty, yet overblown songs which don't have any replay value.Then, there's a syrupy ballad in the mix too which makes me lose a bit of respect for Scott Weiland and co. seeing as how it doesn't belong at all. I know Scott Weiland was going through a lot of stuff but c'mon, nobody wants to hear a ballad at that level.I definitely learned my lesson and that's simply that Stone Temple Pilots fans should avoid this.",2
"Save your cash. They are ghosts of their former selves on this album. I hope they make major improvements before their next. I would, however highly recommend any of their other records.",2
This albumn is a far distant relative from the Core albumn. I am not as impressed whith where STP has gone but more where they started. I will always rate Core as #1.,2
"I'm struggling to figure out which album the rest of the people have listened to? I read the ""critics"" reviews and expected some cool, trippy, mellow songs and some rock songs...I even heard reference to Bossa Nova music? I totally didn't hear that. Maybe I'm a throwback looking for something in particular but I loved all the other albums. I have to listen to it a bunch more times...but if you're looking for instant gratification, this album won't deliver. Maybe that's a good thing?",2
STP has went down hill in the past few years. The first three albums are their best. The last two were decent with some good songs.,2
"I can't give this album one star because it isn't hideous... but its not good either. No wonder they broke up after this ""effort."" Bland, disjointed, and not at all in their character, this STP finale was a huge disappointment for me.Their pinnacle was 1994's ""Purple"" (album number two) followed by ""Tiny Music..."" then ""Core.""""No.4"" wasn't bad but hardly up to the first three they did.As for this stinker, as much as I love this band, I have to say: ""let it go.""",2
"As a diehard stp fan, I must admit that this album should have never been released, or even recorded. This is the worst music that stp could have written, though one and the only bright spot on the cd is the opener Dumd Love. And no they will never make another Core or Purple but they have the talent to write songs that are not a disgrace to the fans such as Shangri-La.",2
"Okay lads, your lead singer happens to have one of the best voices ever to grace a recording studio, and the family connection are capable of writing EXCELLENT songs (this is not that common across the rock music board, otherwise we'd all be stony broke!)and you have FOUR brilliant albums behind you; the previous (NO. 4) album is hugely underrated in my opinion, I love every morsel! (Mind you Tiny Music, Purple and Core have the same exquisite taste...) SO!!! For the benefit of Mr. Kite and all the rest of us: please take your time with the next one, and regain a bit of perspective! By the way, the noises you make still sound great, but this aside - the less said about Shangri-La Dee Da the better.(Too Cool Queenie had potential!). Finish the bloody songs off!! Signed Still A Fan",2
"Possibly the last album from Stone Temple Pilots, 2001's ""Shangri-La Dee Da"" is undoubtadly the worst album from the band. Most of the tracks featured here either sound too poppy or too generic, and the lyrics (""there's so much God can teach you..."") are trite and uninspired. Scott Weiland's voice sounds great though; when this album was being recorded he was cleaned up (for a little while anyway) and his voice greatly benefited. As for the rest of the band though, I can't understand what happened to them here. ""Coma"" and ""Hollywood Bitch"" are standout tracks, but that's about it. All in all, if your a new fan of STP, check out ""Core"" or the brilliant ""Purple"" before listening to this disappointment.",2
"Core (Stone Temple Pilots) first album is a terrible album and so is their last ""Sheeran Laa dee Da""What a lame effort, their are about 2 or 3 decent tracks on this albumthe rest is throw away filler.""Too Cool Queenie"" and ""Dumb Love"" (the first track) are the only stand out tracks.As for ""Days of the week"" being the well known single of the album, all I can sday is that is the worst song I have heard by the Stone Temple Pilots.",2
lots to be desired...to much talk and not enough music. disc was fine.i really wished there was more of a flow with the cd.,2
"LA Song is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. A touching ballad that also has a biting edge. However, after that song I found the rest of the album to be pretty thin. I am not a fan of angst-ridden screaming being passed off as music as I feel so much of this album is. If you like LA Song, I would suggest buying the single. It really is not an accurate reflection of the rest of the album.",2
"Beth Hart has a great voice for soul , blues and country but for every 3 or 4 great songs per album there are 7 0r 8 slow, melancholy stinkers. I like an occasional ballad but Beth needs to get with a producer who won't allow her to record songs which bring down and detract from her up tempo numbers. The record company should issue a collection of all her faster, blusier and rockier songs on one cd and I guarantee sales will triple. It would bring some much needed attention to her career and really showcase her strength as an heir to Janis Joplin.",2
"[...]. I wish I had waited and listened to a few of the sound samples and read a few of the more critical reviews as well. This CD is a disappointment. Mediocre songwriting, Top 40 production and oversinging that would be an embarrassment for a true master of blues, soul or R&B. I can't believe someone compared her to a combination of Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin & Melissa Ethridge. She doesn't come close to any, and I'm no fan of Ms Ethridge. Mabe some of her other titles are better bets, but I went to U-Tube and sampled a few videos of her live performances, and they were not impressive either. I'm puttin' this one back up for trade on Swaptree!",2
"I bought this album because i loved LA Song thinking that the whole album would touch me like that song did. i was incredibly disappointed. Even though she has an incredible voice, i felt that she could have written more original music. Her voice is so unique that i expected more unique lyrics. Instead this cd sounded too pop. Her voice dosen't mesh well with the Brittany Spears type songs. Maybe her next album will be more original.",2
"This receiver has two (2) component video in ports (SAT and DVD) but it only has audio out for one (!). Insane. It could have 200 component video-out ports but if only one of them is capable of audio then what is the point? I have never seen engineering this poor fron a brand known for quality. Advertising this as a product with two component out ports is blatantly lying to the customer. If you don't mind crawling around behind your entertainment center whenever you wish to change from cable to DVD, this is the receiver for you!",2
"Bought this receiver thinking it would give me incredible sound with myBose 2.1 system but was disappointed. I had an older sony str model and got great sound and deep bass. This model, however, does not push my sub to it its potential. It sounds like my bose computer speakers. Stay away!",2
"As an audio receiver it is decent, but if you are looking for an A/V receiver, don't buy this product. It advertises as a 2 hdmi passthru, but you only get 1 optical with video, and at 1080i and no audio thru hdmi. You will end up buying an hdmi switcher that can handle 1080p and audio thru hdmi to minimize cost/clutter in all the cables. (ie. might as well bought more expensive product.) In all the confusion consumers have on trying to buy a quality receiver, I wish Sony would stop making inferior products, and sell just 3 models that better fit an audiophiles profile.",2
I bought this based on the Sony name but after doing so it reminded my why I don't normally buy Sony products. The set up is very confusing and the biggest con is you have to use a TOS link cable to get sound. I eventually found this out after searching on line. The volume is not earth shattering but that can actually be a good thing as there does not seem to be any distortion.,2
"I hoped that this reciever would be decent quality piece of equipment for the price (not asking for perfection, or even close for that matter), but was truly dissappointed after the purchase. This unit's max volume was very low compared to the competition, and at about half volume I could already hear distortion on my fairly expensive Polk Audio speakers. I threw this thing on Ebay within 15 minutes of opening the box. Not bad for the price if sound quality isn't even a little important...",2
"I was disappointed with the contents of the book. I was hoping it would also serve as a field guide for finding the ingredients. The descriptions of the wild foods are not descriptive enough to help you actually find them. Also, there are no pictures of any of the plants. I found most of the recipes to be very complex in flavors. (Mostly Asian and Indian) Not that I mind complex flavors. My fear is the spices would cover up the taste of the wild ingredient to much. The first time I try a new food, I want a simple recipe so I better understand its taste.",2
"I wrote a huge review for this and don't know where it is but let me give you the short version. They don't continue the story, that is until the end of the movie. AND THAT WAS THE PART TRHAT RUINED THE MOVIE FOR ME. The movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married. Enter the Bride. She of course doesn't want anybody to be happy so...The story is not really worth going over, it is just injected and there are no real emotions. Except of course for an ending that really PO'ed me. The only reason this movie gets a 2 stars and almost gets a 3 is for Christy Chung. Not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth, she is a great actress. So I know of 2 movies now that are only worth watching for her, this and Red Wolf. It may be because the people she works with are so terrible, but to tell the truth, Christy Chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time. Not a big deal since it was only like a 77 minute long movie.",2
"Bride with the white hair had hardly any action and really disappointed me. I like the story line and everything and it's pretty sad, but I wanted to see more fight scenes. Don't get this movie is you are expecting action.",2
"The story line is direction is okay. Action sequences are good but not spectacular. Fast-paced and confusing at times. It took me 2-days to watch, since I fell asleep on it the first time.",2
"Baldwin has created a steamy universe with a debauched Emperor and crass commercial Empire. Though the hero, Canby, fights for right, the dark and debauched scenes of sexual orgies -- and in one case pedophilia, make this a book unsuitable for younger readers. Baldwin writes as if he was unhappy with the straightforward good versus evil in the Helmsman series and needed to make a universe reflective of everything that is bad.This is a step down in Baldwin's otherwise finely crafted space operas that are suitable for younger and adventurous teens.Canby's Legion is NOT Suitable for younger readers",2
"Flashes of what could have been a great story, but ultimately disappointing. The final pages seeming attempt to turn the story into a fable were too little too late.",2
"This movie is pointless. It's not erotic. It's not poetic. It's not passionate. It's not dimensional. It's not dramatic. It's just plain boring, and it doesn't even look very good. Most of the film takes place in dark, dingy rooms. The lead actor (Vittoria Gassman's son) is attractive, but not much in the talent department. Skip this movie.",2
"This comedy (so it's called) became a big hit in 1997 and it seemed everyone loved it. However upon buying it on video I found it to be completely dull. Ok odd parts were funny, but it was'nt the funniest film ever, and it's beyond a joke to call it Britains best comedy. I can't see how Americans could like it because the characters talk in a northern accent.",2
"My husband uses I-caps areds formula. This particular I-caps specifies 4 caps per day, where the one we bought from drug store was two caps per day. This was a less potent formula, so not a savings.",2
"As the reviewer stated before, the orange is quite acidic and the carrot juice is not noticeable. Hopefully the benefits of the carrots will still be felt in my body though.I purchased the orange and carrot as the Lakewood brand's Carrot juice has lemon juice in it which is not truly carrots only. Carrots by themselves are excellent in a juice form I don't know why they can't stick to the basics or come up with a better flavor to mix than orange or lemon.",2
"I'd get this book for the quality of the paper and type (at least that of the version I bought back in the early 90s) and the great presentation of the French originals. People with even a high-school knowledge of French can appreciate Baudelaire's ideas and musicality. It's impossible to translate the latter into English, so why even try?The best thing about the ideas in the poems is that they are expressed in very simple language. I would have prefered a similarly simple, immediate English translation without resorting to stuffy ""poetic"" language (as well as over-interpretation--many images sneak into the English that are just not there, or only suggested, in the French). The only way to really appreciate the intricately constructed meter and rhyme is to read the originals.I know this is probably a matter of taste in translation, but reading the English translations in this volume really brings me down sometimes!",2
"The meals in this book are in deed inexpensive but they are very basic and somewhat bland. We've tried at least half the recipes. The recipes are also not diet conscience. Most of the recipes are pretty high in carbs, fat and salt and thus this book was given away. If you are a pretty heavily active, thin family who is pretty much steak and potatoes then you'd love this book. However, if you like variety, new and exciting things to try, this book will leave you hungry for something else.",2
"I was not satisfied with this book. I agree with the other reviewers who pointed out that it is very basic - I think it might be helpful to someone who doesn't have much cooking experience, but if you do it won't help you much. I doubt I will make anything from this book, and I have to say nothing really sounded that great. One of my main problems with this book it that every chicken recipe called for boneless, skinless breasts - how un-frugal can you get?? That is absolutly the most expensive way to buy chicken, and don't tell me it is the only healthy option - it won't kill your family to eat chicken legs once it a while. Give me a break! If you are new to both cooking and frugality, you might get something out of it, but otherwise, take my word for it - you already know everything the author has to say.",2
"I was intrigued at first by the four person viewpoint similar to the Japanese classic Rashomon. Although I finished it, the story began to lose me (I'll try and do this without giving anything away) when Beatrice responds as she does to Warrren. Nothing given to us about his character up to that point would seem to cause her doubts. Not to mention that what finally happens between them seems to evolve not out of the normal flow of their lives but more in the way of an author's attempt to write a potential movie. It had so many possibilities in the beginning but dwindled, at least for me, to hokey contrivances.",2
"It may have all the songs from the air gear anime but, it doesn't have the full version of the opening credits. The music is very techno. The picture on front it good. In the booklet there seems to be the lyrics for the opening song but there in japanese.",2
Three chapters on doing laundry. 30 chapters on trying to get a story published. Stupid ending. Not worth the while.,2
"This album is no more than ordinary. I prefer her chinese albums.And please people stop the hype. Coco will not be the first asian to sing in Oscar, it's Lea Salonga. And the only undefeated asian songstress in music mainstream today is Jocelyn Enriquez. And, this indonesian contemporary ethnic artist named Anggun.",2
"Okay, I admit that Coco Lee can sing a bit better than Britney Spears... But I think that her voice is rather thin although she can sing all the ""Ah""s and ""Ee""s in R&BThe songs in this album seems to be repeating itself... However, there are some nice numbers like ""Do You Want My Love"", ""Just No Other Way"", ""Before I Fall In Love"" and ""All Tied Up""... Other than that, the songs are just like variations of this or that tracks. Further more, most the songs in this album are in slow numbers except for the 1st track which is more exciting... The others can put you slowly to dreamland... As simple as that :-)People in Asia should not buy this album because it is not as good as her Chinese albums. Further more, since Coco Lee hit the U.S. market, she has become more cocky than ever. People in U.S. should buy this album because you would be able to hear a bit more better singing than Britney Spears.",2
"No one should support her just because she is Asian. That is being biased. Only thing I can say is that she needs to bringing in something new...as Jennifer Lopez introduced Latin/Pop/R&B, etc. She should have put some ""Asian"" flavor to her music. I don't know why everyone from all different race is trying to be more ""black"" than black people. What she's doing is everything that was done in 1998-1999. Plus, Kelly Price's song sounds just like Chuckie Booker's song...I mean ""Just Like It."" She can definitely use some new song writers. Her title track ""Do You Want My Love"" features an un-known rapper who is a cheap copy of Kid Capri...Anyways, for all of you interested in this album, just download it via MP3...",2
"After I listened the CD for few times I find it tiring. Lack of decent lyrics and the melody is pretty much copy of others. There was nothing special in her album. Her Chinese CD's were pretty decent I am just disappointed that this CD ain't as good as her chinese CD's. Maybe it's the U.S. marketing strategy, I really think this CD can be a lot better. Besides, she is not the best singer that I have heard. Try Shanza, Sandy Lam, Sally Yeh and others.",2
"Coco is a major star in Chinese speaking countries and although not poweful, she can actually sing. Her first English album is a main stream oriented R&B, hip hop and I admire her guts. However, her problem with this album is very weak song writing and no originality. I only liked the first song and that's about it. She has a great potetial to have hits though, only if someone writes a good heartfelt song for her. I am not sure if R&B, bad girl image is the right track for her, since she lacks the attitude. Hoping everything will be better in her next album.",2
"Sorry to say, She didnt make it here in the U.S. Her songs are just as generic as some other artist. Shes only popular to her own fellow asians(mostly chinese i suppose) Voice quality? unsurprising and not convincing enough to American Market. Here in America, competition comes first. Originality here comes first, and of course good music. one instance, Macy Gray, good music and creativity. not just by copying others craft. Shes not pretty but American loved her songs. She has an interesting voice may not be compared to Mariah, Whitney or Celine but you will know that she owns it. Its her trademark. And, one thing why asians will never make it here in US? coz they always compare theirselves to foreign artists. Its like they cant be what should they supposed to be and not taking ones name to gain popularity. Its either the artists will be blamed or the media. You know? Asian thingy!!",2
"I am a great Li Wen fan. I have every CD. So don't go bashing me. But come on let's be honest. This album sucks. I don't like any song here (maybe wherever you go) Of all the albums on amazon Didadi is the only one that should be bought. You and me isn't that great either. Coco is just following whatever is popular at the time. (dance, latin etc) Doesn't have any identity.Her old ones are on a totally differnet level compared to this bomb. The only reason I treasure this CD/ALBUM is that I got it autographed when she came here several years ago. Oh and I also hate the album photos. Who took those shots? Geez.",2
"It seems like most of the songs from CoCo Lee's US debut ""Just No Other Way"" were rejects that werern't put on Jennifer Lopez' album ""On The 6"". Thank God for that! CoCo even used some of the same producers that Jennifer used (a la Ric Wake). Other than the standout track and first single, ""Do You Want My Love"" (produced by one of my favorite house remixers, Frankie Knuckles), the rest of the songs are really filler. And a guest appearance by Kelly Price on this album isn't going to help make this album any better.I don't think Sony really marketed this album well enough before it was released. They should have at least allowed ""Do You Want My Love"" some major radio airplay and maybe some heavy video rotation on MTV. They could've even released ""Do You Want My Love"" as a commercial single before releasing the album. All in all, ""Just No Other Way"" isn't going to get far and it's just going to be another album with almost no worth or creativity in it.",2
"Coco Lee *can* sing. However, I don't understand how we're supposed to figure that out on this sugar-coated, overly-synthesized, horribly-written album. You'd think that Sony would have had the savvy to realize that this cheesy pop stuff (it's NOT R&B! ) would not be recevied well in the US. I wish Ms. Lee the best of luck and I hope that Sony will give her another chance at the US market -- maybe next time she'll be able to work on material that doesn't make me want to curl under my bed and scream.",2
"This is not bad, but not too good either. I'd rather spend $35 on Faye Wong's cd and love all the songs than to spend about $15 to buy a cd that sounds so similar to all the others.--U want something worth your $$? Try Faye Wong.",2
"Sure, it's good to see an Asian artist trying to break into the U.S. barrier, but this album won't do it. I have nothing against Coco, she has a nice voice, and while this cd somewhat demonstrated that with interesting voice ranges, it's not something to cling on. Coco's style is not very eccentric to be noticed really. Her music is R&B/POP, a dying and yet overrated market. If you want to listen to some backed washed familiar forgetful pop, this isn't a bad choice. It won't leave much affect though.",2
"I'm afraid the performance is neither interesting nor passionate. The story is contrived and incredible. After reading several disappointing books with raving reviews, I'm getting wary about buying books which are written by relatively new and unknown wirters.",2
"I bought all the Brunetti books through The Girl of His Dreams at one time (having just discovered the novels) and from Uniform Justice on, they get progressively worse. Leon has become wildly anti-American to the point of absurdity, pulling out every sterotype imaginable. Plus she focuses on the environment to the extent of forgetting what sort of book she is writing. Once, for a theme, is fine; time after time is just distracting. But most of all, from this novel on, she forgets that books must have an ending. From Uniform Justice through the next six books I read, she has no sense of justice and the books essentially end with the rich and powerful literally getting away with murder. Once, like in Uniform Justice, okay, but enough is enough. No matter how much Brunetti is a compelling character, his wife has turned into a nutter and the books are depressing. Read the series through Wilful Behavior, then stop.",2
"This is the third and last of her books I will read. The other two were not all that intriguing and the endings were disappointing. At the end the question in you mind was: 'That's it? That's all there is to this?'This one was different. It is one of those books that keeps you up at night because you want to read a few more pages before turning out the lights. But then you reach the end and you are appalled. I won't give away the ending but it will offend your sense of justice.Donna Leon's books have two parts. One part is the mystery. That is fiction. The second part is about Italy. Because of her extensive experience there, that is fact. The picture of the venality and corruption she paints in her books has taken some of the shine off the impression I got from a three-week tour in 2012.I wanted to go back but now I'm not so sure I will.",2
"I was rather disappointed by this book. The mystery starts off as rather interesting, but one sees the solution quite early on. What gets very tiresome is the continuous political preaching. Ms Leon is entitled to her opinions, and I do not mind their being mentioned occasionally under the guise of a character's beliefs. But this was really too much: it is supposed to be a mystery, not a political platform.",2
"The family dog is mutilated. The family is in danger so they jump into their truck to escape and it won't start. Two horror movie cliches within the first 5 minutes of the movie. I should have just turned it off and saved my time.Alex is a 25 year old whose intellect begins to grow by leaps and bounds. He can read entire books in seconds and remember everything he's read. He teaches himself to be a chess master in a matter of days. He also sees creatures in his dreams that begin to come to life, murdering people Alex has come into contact with. He goes to friends and doctors searching for answers to what is happening to him.The box made Head Space sound interesting but it wasn't. This was 90 turgid minutes of middling acting and bad plotting. The makeup on the creatures was ok. This movie wasn't exciting, suspenseful or scary.",2
"Mos Def is one of the most musically talented individuals in the game today, but what happen to lines like ""lyrically handsome""? New Danger is really different when compared to other Mos Def albums. I think Mos Def is trying to bring a new element of jazz/rock into his beats. Some of it works, but most of it did not. I think I will have to listen to it more to really appreciate what Mos Def is trying to convey. But from what I heard, I am a little disappointed.",2
"I've been there with Mos from the beginning. I'm extremely disappointed in this jambalaya album. Do not buy this album. We can't encourage this kind of behavior from our better hip-hop artists. There is only one Andre. Advice to MD, get back to hip-hop. It needs you. Don't ever push Rock & Roll on us again. I'm just so disappointed.P.S. Minnesota is not new to the game....check Money Boss Players from the mid 90's. Minne's been layin it down for a long time.",2
"I REALLY LOVE MOS, BUT I HATE THIS ALBUM. THERE ARE 3, MAYBE 4 GOOD SONGS ON THIS SELL-OUT FEELING ALBUM. THE SONG WRITING LACKS THE SUBSTANCE, AND DEPTH THAT MOS FANS MAY BE USED TO. THE CONSTANT REPEATING OF; YEAH YEAH, UH COME ON UH, LEAVES ME WONDERING WHERE ARE THE LYRICS? IF YOU LOVE THE THINGS THAT SEPERATED MOS DEF FROM STANDARD HIP HOP DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM.",2
"I never expect that I will get sleepy while I'm listening a mos def album,I know he wanna make a diffecence music,he want to make some brand new stuff that the world never heard before,but it's a flop....I buy this album without listen,because itrust and love mos def,but I'm disappointed!",2
"this Album is closer to a 2&half for me.I applaud Mos Def's ability to Channel in many various Musical Sources for this set. Problem is while He can play different Instruments He also trys to take on to many roles as a Artist. you are left with a Set that while it has upside it also has downside.I think if this set had have dropped 3-4 years back the Buzz would be stronger&I beleive the Set would have been seen on point with what He was trying to do with His Black Jack Johnson Project.""Black on Both Sides"" is a Good Set this set could have been even better with trimming some things off&If it had have dropped a few years back.alot of interesting ideas but alot also taking up space.""The Rape Over"" is a tight cut.",2
"This album was sadly disappointing. Quoting Jay-Z, ""what more can I say?"".... Mos Def's newest album ""New Danger"" has fallen victuim to a TERRIBLE sophomore slump! I waited fro this album with great anticipation, knowing that Mos was a great lyrical artist. He is a part of the great hip hop group BlackStar, whose lyrics are only rivaled by maybe a Nas or 2 Pac. I thought this album would be great, sh** was I wrong! I wasn't even close, this album was so weak. Every track seemed to be rock-ish, I wan't sure if I was listening to Mos Def or AC/DC. Talib Kweli's album was far FAR better than Mos Def's. I think i was being kind giving this album 2 stars... i think it was out of respect of what he's done in the past. Mos better step it up on his next album, because Kweli is blowing up, and I like Mos Def too much to see him living in the shadow of Kweli's fame.",2
"There are a few tracks on this Cd that are pretty tight - but there are some where it's not at all classic Mos Def. I have his black on both sides as well as the 4 CD pack made by Sattan (not available worldwide) and this new CD is totally off, with a lot of rock incorporated for no reason - where Mos is screaming throughout the songs. Just meaningless yelling. And there's even a song that he produced that is all music - rock music - and he doesn't even rap at all. It just seems like he's trying to be too creative and not holding on to his roots.",2
"Mos Def can flow like no other as tracks like Close Edge demonstrate. Unfortunately, that track is a gem surrounded by tired, rap-rock garbage. I guess for some that's a good thing, but for me, blaaaah.",2
"I'm a SUPA DUPA Mos Def fan (I even like Mos Def BETTER than Talib Kweli!!!)...but you gotta be an official d*** rider to like ""this"" album. This album is HORRIBLE!!! Don't get me wrong...there are a ""FEW"" hot joints on this album (not enough to ""save"" the album though), but if you don't like to waste money...I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend that you give this album a listen BEFORE buying it. If you don't know much about Mos Def, then DONT buy this album...get the ""Black Star"" album and/or the ""Black On Both Sides"" album instead. Those are SURE shots.",2
"I have to say that Mos kinda crapped out on this one. I was expecting a lot more out of this album than what I got. The album is ok, but I wouldn't go running around telling people to buy it. I stlll will enjoy Mos on other levels,,,specifically I against I, a track you can find on Daddy G's album. That track is amazing. Sorry Mos, you should of worked harder on this one",2
"I've been spending the past few weeks studying for the GRE. I've read the majority of the books out there that tell how to study for the exam. And I've found that the Arco book is not very good. While it may have numerous practice problems, it does not contain very much information about how to solve the problems. For example, when it comes to antonyms, the book suggests that if you don't know the meaning of a word, click (C) and move on. I advise reading the Kaplan book. It was by far the most informative of the lot.",2
This is not a study guide by any stretch of the imagination. Go through the practice exams and discard. CD-ROM is a nice addition.,2
"A film trying to emulate the best of Hitchcock, doesn't quite succeed. The plot doesn't make 100 percent sense. A reasonbly ordinary man is caught up in great events. He is charged with solving two mysteries: what happened to Clair and breaking a new German code. Somehow he manages to solve both mysteries at the same time. The best parts of the film are the police interrogations. Those scenes are crisp and dramatic. Wait for the DVD.",2
"Like the previous reviewer, this film has haunted me since first seeing it at a Sacramento drive-in during the late 60's. But, not for the same reasons. The movie itself is interesting, but barely so. What is exceptional is the opening titles. A beautifully crafted montage showing the Monterey and Big Sur coastline while 's lush, haunting arrangements of ""The Shadow of Your Smile"" played in the background. WOW! Variations of the title theme are interwoven throughout the movie, making it a a worthwhile experience.",2
"ok, now THIS one is dick & liz at their most self-indulgent. even ""boom"" (not yet released on dvd, alas) is a better movie, if only because it is sooooo bad. it is amazing to realize that right after this, arguably her worst performance, taylor went on to give her best in ""virginia wolff"". i have given this a second star because the shorts about the making of the film (included on the dvd) are pretty interesting. only for dick & liz completists.",2
"When purchasing any kind of cooking video/lesson, you anticipate that recipes will be included with the lesson... There were no recipes included, and these cooking videos were extremely disappointing. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the instructors are all very young chefs who are VERY fond of their cooking. I did not learn anything and was not happy that I purchased these videos.",2
"No measured recipes, odd pacing and the music was distracting as were the chef vinettes. I do NOT recommend this to anyone!",2
"Adult literary techniques do not always translate well to children's books. Although there is some interesting insight into the lives of children that shows through this book, the writing is forced. Having not read the other Rootabaga Stories, I can't say if Sandburg wrote everything this way, but this particular story is probably one of the most annoying books I've read to my child. The awkward illustrations didn't help either.Having said that, a book is a book and everybody enjoys different kinds of books. I would simply recommend checking it out at the library before you buy it.",2
"Kenyon is a real ""hit and miss"" author. I have decided her books fall into 3 categories - ""Buy,"" ""Borrow"" and ""Don't Bother."" This books falls between ""Borrow"" and ""Don't Bother"" book in the Dark Hunter series. The one good thing going for it, is that is gives the other side's (Daimons'/Apollites') point of view.The reason for the 2 stars instead of 1 star rating, is because I just finished reading the first book in the Dream Hunter series which had to be rated 1 star since you cannot assign a zero value!",2
"I have to say this was the weakest dark hunter novel to date. Storyline way to conjested and complicated. Sometimes I had a hard time rembering the hero and heroines names so many new characters were introduced in this novel. And whats so bad about it is that all the external characters were more entertaining than the hero and heroine. The Phoebe/Urian romance was hotter than the main characters. Will chalk this one up to everyone has a bad moment, and its easy to do since all her other work was so great. I will just focus on next time and hope for better days.",2
I felt this 5th book in the series that the author ran out of steam. It was extremely rushed and forced. I thought mortal enemies coming together would be more exciting. This stretched the impossible a little too far for me. I felt the 2 characters connected too soon and for no good reason. Too much discussion of the history of their race and not about their romance.,2
"I'm not sure what I was thinking getting this. I wanted something that would hold my drinks (like my son's old sturdy stroller) and provide more storage. It does not hold drinks, they all fall over if you put anything in the drink holder. And the pocket is nice for keys and other things, but if my son is not in the stroller it is back heavy and falls over. I wish I kept the box so I could return it.",2
"I really wanted to love this product, but I have to say I've only used it a couple times. It just isn't as practical as it looks. It's nice to have the cup holders, but they only fit bottled beverages. The netted portion is REALLY deep, making it very difficult to get items out of it.",2
"I bought this for the cupholders. I haven't found a single water bottle, mug, cup, etc that has been able to fit into them. I have the Techno XT which already has storage, so this extra bag wasn't really needed, only the cupholders, which aren't useful to me. I wish I hadn't bought it :\",2
"The original 119 minute version of The Big Blue featuring the superb soundtrack by Bill Conti is my favorite film of all time. After purchasing Bessons Director's cut DVD (the only DVD version available) I found that it greatly slows the pace of the movie while adding very little story. The new accompanying musical score by Eric Sierra is bland and combined with the different ending, the feel of the original film is destroyed. I regret buying this DVD.",2
"I didn't notice the import when I ordered this item, it's factory made and is poor quality.The Big Blue: Le Grand Bleu (Director's Cut - Import)",2
quality of the actual CD is poor and it's hard to watch the whole movie without skipping passage...,2
"I absolutely love this movie. However, I am American and I probably fell in love with it more because of the music than the actual movie (though I do love the movie also). Luc Besson did an excellent job. I am glad he changed the music from Eric Serra to Bill Conti for the American version. It would however, have been nice to see the full length with the Bill Conti music. I have heard both soundtracks and in my mind, Bill Conti created the only music for this film. I won't be buying the DVD since it contains the Eric Serra soundtrack but I finally found the American version on VHS (out of print now).",2
I arrived at this book when I was doing searches on a refrence to help me use WinInet with Visual Basic. The book is not really a VB book at all. It barely mentions how to accomplish the tasks of their projects in VB. Everything is aimed at C++.,2
"Dear Reader,I usually enjoy Michael Stackpole books very much. It greatly pains me to write a poor review for one of his books. Quite frankly, however, The Grand Crusade stinks! At the risk of spoiling the novel I pose this question: Why ""kill off"" the most likable character of the series and then bring him back as an animated slab of lava? Another question: Is it really necessary to include the romance scenes between the old man and the hot twenty-something? It was sick enough to make me put the book down and watch ""Simpsons"" reruns. Worst Series Ending Ever!",2
"I was lucky enough to find a first edition copy of this book in a local bookstore. I bought it for its date (1928) and the excellent wood-cut illustrations scattered throughout. Inside was glued a newspaper review placed there by (I assume) the first owner -- it was an interesting enough find. Of course I read the book, though solely out of curiosity and the fact that I had forgotten Esther Forbes' authorship of the lame novel Johnny Tremain. The book read quickly, though seemed more like a novel from the 19th century than one from the Jazz Age. The content was interesting, but neither 'engaging' nor 'vigorous' as its newspaper review had led me to believe. On the whole, though I admit my pride regarding the ownership of the unique 1st edition, I do not plan on recommending the book to anyone not extensively studying literature regarding early witchery or the behavioral history of early Salem, Massachusetts inhabitants.",2
I expected a little more from this brand. The case fits so well and protects the phone. The sides of this case discoloured within the first two weeks of using and now looks very average. Would not purchase again.,3
The set is fine overall for the price. The metal on all knives is rather thin and somewhat flexible. Not the best quality but suitable for home use. The wood block holds all the knives but maybe could have been a darker wood. Like previously mentioned for the price its fine. How they will hold up is a test of time.,3
"This is the lamest product design ever. It does not store easily as advertised because all the stuff that comes with it doesn't fit in it. Not even the manual! I couldn't even figure out how to get it back in the box it came in. So now I have to buy a box to put it all in, so I don't lose pieces and parts. Very, very, very disappointed. This problem could have been easily avoided with a better design for the product, or if they included a plastic box just big enough to store everything in.The cutting area is pretty small, so you have to cut your produce or whatever in half or so, so that it will fit on the cutting area and you can close the unit to do the cutting. Again, lame!!! Again, the problem could be easily avoided by making the product larger in general. That said, it does cut as advertised, at least with the ""garnish blade"".I bought this specifically for making Pico. That means using the small and maybe the large dicing blades. The goal was to have a quicker and easier way to do it, rather than using my big kitchenaid mixer with the food processing attachment. That device does a wonderful job by the way, but our kitchen is very small so my wife makes me store it in the basement. My goal with THIS product was to have something I could keep in the kitchen cabinet.I didn't have everything I needed to make pico tonight, so I used it to make fajitas. I cut onions and three different kinds of peppers with it. For the onion, I had to cut that in half to make it fit in the cutting area so it would cut. For the big bell peppers, I had to cut them in half, and then in half then other way. I really expected better.Overall, the plastic is decent quality for the purpose, as far as I can tell. It also cleaned up fairly easily.I can't comment on its various other functions yet, as I just got the thing yesterday! But that didn't stop Amazon from asking for a review, so here it is.",3
"The product is not heavy but still will serve the purpose for our event. However, no screws were included and need to find replacements.;",3
Came dented and didn’t have enough time before my gathering to get a new one. Otherwise it works fine,3
"I expect a fluffy quilt. This is a flat blanket, nothing more.",3
"I love the scent, but the scent didn’t last. I’ve shaken it and added more stick, flipping everyday. I wish it was better.",3
The media could not be loaded. The color and shelf itself is pretty. I expected to be sturdier for prize. The concept is smart but they needed to add possibly another bar within the shelf to actually support better. Limited use for shelf because when adding additional items the shelf starts to lower in front part and looks like items will fall off and it’s not flush against the wall. I expected more considering price. Very cute design and great if hanging lighter items then books or albums. Great if for Knick knacks. Would not repurchase for my intended use.,3
"When I saw this online, I thought it was cute and decided to buy this as a Christmas gift for my in-laws. However, after receiving it, I don’t think the quality is too good and I’m really disappointed in the magnets. The concept is nice, but the magnets I received are all marked up and chipped. Very disappointing.",3
It's a nice looking decoration. Plastic and smaller than expected. I should have read the complete description but skipped ahead when it was on sale.,3
A bit smaller than I expected,3
"It's a very good computer, very pleasing to the eye. The only problem I have with it is that it's incompatible with the windows 11 upgrade. I honestly thought I grabbed the windows 11 PC but unfortunately I didn't. Besides that little hiccup, it runs smoothly.",3
"Cpu cooler is bad but the pc is good value for the discount, also it is very difficult if you want to upgrade it since the specs are propierty",3
"It's good enough for gaming. RAM, not the best—you could buy more yourself. But looking back, given all of these components this thing is super overpriced. You could build your own for half the price with the same components. Either look for another product or just build your own.",3
For the customers: this is what you should know it does not have a Optical drive a.k.a. DVD player they should put that in the description saying it doesn’t have one but it’s not there it doesn’t say it does or doesn’t either way I want to use it for other things other than gaming the loads really fast in the Internet is really fast when it’s loaded the games take less time to download to my previous computer I played breath edge and it works fine just got hiccups here and there but you can upgrade.this the other problem is there’s no option or any way to put a optical drive in not a single port and that really ticks me off if you didn’t have one it should be advertise not having one and I would’ve went with the $600 one with the warranty about 700 which only had three fans and 250 Megabytes. The only other option is to go in a sternal optical drive a.k.a. DVD player CD player that’s also a pain in the ass you have to make sure that it’s able to read not just burn learned that the hard way make sure you read the descriptions and look for what is and what isn’t mentioned.To the manufacturer: this is borderline false advertisement you should really mention that it doesn’t have one if you’re not going to install it or even an option for someone who buys it to put one in themselves not everyone streams games online some people still get hardcopies that’s something to take in mine I don’t have a problem with the look I do have a problem with not seeing or mentioning certain things in your description for future references this would be best if an external hard drive doesn’t work I will be getting a full refund and I’m going with a different company very disappointed.,3
For old games 100% good but when you got some récent games you gonna surfer. But you know i run obs and my games Steel pretty descent bit it works,3
So everything arrived in time and everything worked BUT the monitor. Like the monitor flashes. Which is sad. My son got creative and used an old tv to connect everything. But keyboard quality is good and everything else but the monitor is good.,3
Looks good. Very compact. Does not upgrade and very limited in what games you can play.So i returned it. Still waiting for my refund. Was sent back over 1 month ago.,3
"I have the series S 500gig from when they came out. The 1tb unit should be just as fast “actually faster” to load since it’s a better read/write SSD BUT ITS NOT. Already tried to exchange it since the Xbox reb said it should run great but they would only exchange it with a refurb. And 90 day warranty when I payed for the year warranty but it’s not transferable or refundable. GOING TO STICK WITH PC GAMING, consoles are just not worth it.",3
It works plays the games but it does like to turn on its own when not it use. Has turned off on its own while using it but not when playing a game.other than that works great,3
"The build quality of this stand is excellent and the lights look great, there are just two issues with it. Firstly, this rubber appendage sticking out at me. I have a wireless mouse so have literally no use for this, I'm able to remove it but now have this ugly gaping hole instead. I may be able to ignore it or try and cover it, but for a premium stand this is a bit daft.However the most irritating problem is that the stand doesn't retain the colour I last set it to. I use a docking station and frequently switch between machines, and every time I do I have to keep pressing the button until I get back to my colour.It may sound like a petty complaint but this isn't the cheapest stand on the market and this is a really stupid problem to have. If my cheap and crappy £10 mousepad from China can do it then I don't see why this can't.",3
"For the price and renewed original Xbox Console, you might think you'd be getting a good deal. Little did I know that the pop-open tray couldn't slide out on the first day of gaming my favorite game, that being the ""Counter-Strike"" Shooter game for the Original Xbox. So I say to myself: either I leave the Disc inside the Xbox, play CS, and make a promise to myself not to break the disk tray even more. Turns out the console works, but no CD Pop-Out capability. Still works fine. Dare I remove that disc for a different game from the Disk tray, and I would be asking for a no longer working Xbox. however the good news I have to share with you all is that I can still play Counter-Strike on the renewed Xbox I ordered, but I can't play other games because I'm too afraid the tray might get stuck and possibly break. So a word to the wise ""If it's broken, but still works, then don't break it anymore."" I guess the Xbox has been around for a very long time. Meaning old products come with defects or some kind of technical problem that can't be fixed. But on a good note, Whenever I look at my turned off Xbox, and see the game controller connected to the console, I get the feeling it's telling me to load up Counter-Strike for one more round. Looking at it, makes me want to call this console, the Counter-Strike Xbox!",3
"After a few days with the phone, I can say that it's pretty sub-par. It's definitely a step up from my previous device, but I honestly expected more from a 5G Galaxy device in 2024.The camera is nice, and the body is solid. The screen is beautiful, visually, but is slow and unresponsive, at times refusing to register taps and swipes.I've owned Galaxy devices before, but the Samsung bloatware on this one takes the cake. Dozens of apps are preloaded that you'll have to either disable or uninstall to get some of the precious memory back, and OneUI is aggressively intrusive, causing compatibility and sign in issues with just about everything you want to use.I suppose this is a case of get-what-you-pay-for, but the user experience seems oddly frustrating, given the promised five years of support.This phone has reaffirmed that the Samsung device environment is not for me.",3
"Product arrived nicely packaged and not damaged with all parts in place. After I hooked everything up I went to open the disc tray and it would not open. This was the exact same issue I had on my previous Xbox 360. After fighting with the disc tray I was able to get open.Xbox would repeatedly “freeze” and become unresponsive. Only way to correct issue was to unplug power.Do yourself a favor and either don’t buy, or make sure you get a warranty. I was able to return mine and the seller was very easy to work with on the refund process.",3
Not enough storage to keep 10 games on it and expansion storage is as expensive as console and external hard drive you have to move games back and forth to play,3
"After purchasing the ""3 Tube"" lamp; I went on to get the ""Shark"" and the ""Jellyfish"" lamps and neither had the USB or battery power sources. Also they didn't have the touch button to change the colors. Still a cool little light sculptures but I got a definite sense of El Cheapo. If this doesn't bother you then go ahead with the purchase. For my use, the USB &a battery setup was a major consideration, and I probably would not have bought the other 2 had I known, but all 3 models were in the same product description.",3
This product looks nice but I find it too bright to be used as a night light. I could also not find a dimmer switch that worked to dim this lamp.,3
"His foot ripped off, leaking sand everywhere. No way to fix it.",3
"Was very hopeful that this product would reduce the coffee stains on my teeth. After applying the toothpaste and scrubbing and scrubbing, I couldn't get the purple off that had stained the tartar in between my teeth. It took a couple more intense sessions to fade the purple. There was some fading on the stains on the surface of the teeth but didn't want to look like a Halloween ghoul so did not continue to use.",3
is ok not what expected,3

Great product.,3
"This toothpaste gets your teeth clean. I find that other natural toothpastes don’t get your teeth as scrubbed clean like the usual Colgates, Crest, etc. toothpastes, however, this one did. The purple color was did not stain your teeth and it actually lathers up well and turns white. The taste wasn’t off-putting and wasn’t too mild nor too overwhelming. I don’t know if it whitened my teeth much, but one of my friends told me that for teeth whitening toothpastes to work you actually have to let them sit on your teeth for at least 15 minutes each time you brush. I am trying to implement that into my daily routine. For the price, and compared to other whitening toothpastes, I don’t think the price is worth it.",3
"So, I have been using this toothpaste for about 2 months now. Not really seeing any whitening effects, but otherwise really like it. Nice flavor, gentle on my gums, teeth feel clean. No bad morning breath. But this is dang expensive to not whiten my teeth. Likely won't reorder at this price",3
"It’s ok, it I like the pastier ones better. This is the equivalent of foamed hand soap as opposed to regular hand soap. Will look for a different one next time",3
"Used with both Crest and Colgate toothpastes. Instead of a screw-tight fit, the cap will begin to just spin. That said, if you tighten to just before it starts spinning, then it work fine. Just be aware that it's essentially still an open tube so toothpaste will dry a bit over time.",3
Doesn’t fit my grandsons toothpaste tube,3
"The formula definitely offers a very temporary Whiteness to teeth, but sadly does not last further than a few minutes.There is also no cleaning component within the foam.Although it does taste quite nice and gives an immediate whiteness, the product does not live up to the hype.",3
I didn’t notice a difference with my teeth. Not pleased.,3
"It’s not “unflavored,” it’s sweetened with sorbitol. My bad, should have read the ingredient list. Otherwise, I like it: a little foam, a good clean feel to my mouth.",3
"Usually love Colgate, but this toothpaste has a runny consistency and my daughter gets it all over the place. She loves the flavor, but I am not a fan.",3
Lovely taste.. Kids love it.. But oh my the price is ridiculous. Won't be buying this again.,3
Got this after watching videos and seeing reviews of how great it works. I have been using it for over a week now and see no difference in the whitening of my teeth. The paste also globs up on my teeth and doesn't distribute evenly. Don't trust purple tooth paste.,3
"This was too gritty, got stuck between my teeth and I needed to floss and rinse after brushing. The flavor was good and my teeth felt clean but i just can't get over how gritty it is.",3
"I barely got into toothpaste tablets and tried out NOBS really like it so I seen these at a better price, but very brittle and my mouth didn’t feel so clean after. I would use 3 tablets just to feel clean.",3
"The media could not be loaded. My ear canals must be very clean, because nothing came out while using this, except the irrigation water. I heated the water to 98° F. Never use cold or hot water to irrigate your ears. It should always be around body temperature. This product has 4 streams of water and different levels of pressure. The pressure was good, but no ear wax came out. I really wanted to like this, but after using it, my ears actually felt plugged. Two hours later and lots of q-tips trying to soak up the moisture, my ears still feel plugged. From now on, I will leave ear irrigation to the professionals.",3
works ok doesnt have as much pressure as i hoped however i do understand why too much and water would shoot out the my other ear,3
"I think I was expecting more because of the brand. It would be nice if the chambers marked which ways the batteries went in. The product doesn’t feel solid. Seems cheaply made and, it’s really loud. It would also be nice if there were a carry case or bag for the brush heads.",3
"I have mixed feelings about this ear wax camera. I thought maybe I would be able to see down my ear canal to the eardrum, but that is not possible because the canal curves. Also, the scraper sits in front of the camera and would need to be way down the canal before the camera could see. I don’t feel this is safe to put down the ear canal. The metal scrapers included with the kit are definitely not safe. Don’t put this stuff down your ear canal! Leave that to doctors.Now the mixed feeling part is because the camera is actually pretty cool. You can see things really close up. It functions like a low power microscope displaying on your phone. I ran it across my skin and could see every pore and every hair and every blemish in super close detail. Creepy looking honestly. I was able to see around the sides of my teeth close up. I could see the individual pixels on my TV screen. You get the idea. The app takes pictures and video too.",3
"This does work, but only for a few minutes before the water runs out. I will only get it out for small jobs. I personally really don't like having to stop and wait for the cool down and then the heat up to only get to work for a couple of minutes.That being said, I have never used a steamer before and I was able to quickly understand what to do to get this working. The instructions are pretty well written. Not perfectly clear, but good enough.The included measuring cup is very convenient as it is marked with the maximum amount of water you can put in.I tested mine on buildup in a shower. I tried it out on glass shower doors and on the bottom of the tub and on some grout. I did need to learn to go slower with it and let the steam do its job. I do think I will get better at it over time. If I can be patient enough to wait through the process.",3
"I bought this to help me clean my showers because of my hands. It is easy to use, but it does not clean the way I was hoping. The Speeds are ok, but the top speed you really have to hold on tight. Also I had to put a lot of pressure to scrub, still it did not clean the build up in my shower. I would like to have at least one cleaning head with harder bristles for the more harder cleaning. After I charged it the first time I've used it 3 times for about 15 mins. and it's still working so I guess the battery is pretty good. I think I'm going to keep it to wash my cars or some mild cleaning.",3
If I could have tested this product before buying I would not have purchased. It doesn’t do a great job and cleaning the base boards like advertised. It doesn’t bend at the bottom so it’s hard to maneuver to me. It also keeps coming detached from the bottom while using. Not my favorite! May return.,3
It is easy to apply with your hands but I prefer using a small plastic spoon. It dries well and it's easy to peel off leaving the skin firm. Its gentle on the skin and gets the dead skin off. The only bad thing is the freshly applied gel sting the eyes a little bit at first when it's less than 1 in from your eyes. After a sec it's OK. Would prob test another peel off mask before buying again.,3
"My skin feels nice enough after using this mask but there are two big cons that make me hesitant to reorder this.1. You need to use a fair bit to create a thick enough layer that doesn't break off into bits while removing it.2. It has a very strong, glue like smell. It's really overpowering and having to put so much on your face doesn't help.I'll keep using it but I'm not sure if the results I gain are significant enough to justify the cost and cons.",3
"I tried to make a picture of how it feels to look through these things. As a novelty, they work well, but for any serious reading, the tiny size of the viewing windows are a constant detriment. I would recommend you keep looking for a horizontal reading solution. The technology is not there yet. Larger prisms, a wider nose bridge, and more plastic material around the frame edges would improve these a lot.The prisms are quite small, measuring about 27mmx44mmx32mm; apparently, you're hard-pressed to find any silvered prisms larger than this, which is a real pity. With larger prisms and a larger viewing window, these could be great for reading books from a comfortable distance, and not with the text in line with ones nipples.This means that the actual portion of my field of view that the image takes up is not even 40%. This might be able to be improved, if the nose bridge were not so extremely narrow so that you cannot slide them all the way on your face. I do not have an exceptionally large nose, or maybe I do; I cannot put these on my face nearly far enough to close out all the exterior sights and shadows. I have worn large over-the-glasses shades before, and they shut out the light nicely around the edges of my vision. These are too small to do so. They are perched on my nose like Ben Franklin reading spectacles.There is ghosting on the viewing image, like when you put your face very near a mirror and can see a slight... ghostly image. This is probably unavoidable due to the nature of light refracting through a prism, but still detracts from the reading experience considerably when there is a superimposed mirror ghost image over the bottom half of the book. I have tried to show this in my mockup photo.There is an upside-down image above each eye, which is even more distracting than the superimposed ghost image. This does not seem to be avoidable either.They fit over my glasses nicely, which I didn't expect. That is nice, because in contrast to one reviewer's husband's experience, I CANNOT see in focus through these without my glasses.The sides of the prisms are shiny, and having three large vertical whitish bars is also rather distracting when reading. There might not be any way to make these less obtrusive, but a matte finish or different color or angle might improve this aspect.",3
"These are the best readers I've come across yet, being autofocus is the best! The only problem I have is the quality of the plastic in the frames because they don't last they crack and fall apart so the price reflects that by many it's still worth the money.",3
"What does auto focus means? Not what I was thinking, these are simple reading glasses.",3
Good for reading,3
The glasses are very heavy and not real comfortable but the idea of them is still good.,3
"It does work, but it does mess with youMakes you feel weirdLittle dizzyI just didn’t like how I felt after I used it for a little bit",3
"I was actually excited to try this item, simply for the novelty of such a product and also because, well, let’s face it… I’m lazy. I’ve only used these glasses once or twice while laying bed so I could watch TV while also reading during the commercials, and I don’t think I’ll be keeping them because they aren’t really good for long-term, practical use.As far as ‘periscope’ vision goes, the glasses didn’t seem to provide as steep of an angle as I was expecting, therefore I was a bit disappointed.It was certainly interesting to try, but it felt a bit awkward wearing them and it was disorienting/dizzying and almost nauseating for me to have them on for more than a few minutes at a time. The glasses don’t exactly provide the crispest vision since you’re viewing a reflection of an image, so naturally it’s a bit discombobulating.And of course anyone wearing these looks absolutely ridiculous – I felt like I looked like Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob 😂So in summary, this would make a great gag gift or stocking stuffer as long as you don’t take it too seriously or expect too much from it.",3
"- Light & works as intended.- Though the area the glass covers is small, so I’m able to see surrounding area, which is kinda annoying.",3
"I was hopeful that these would work well. I wanted to put them on a couple sunglasses that do no have a bifocal magnification. With all honesty - I was disappointed. I followed the directions as given - and I have a great pair of Ray Bans with flat lenses - they are just not 'sticking' like I had hoped. With a 2.50 magnification, they are also a little thicker than I had expected. They DO help with reading.Will they work in a pinch? Maybe......I'm a little nervous to wear them for fear the magnification lens will fall off. I purchased two sets - so I'll try them and see what happens. Not horribly confident, though.",3
"There are problems with multiple reflections, they're also too heavy to wear for long. A clever idea that's too hard to execute.",3
Worked great to blocking sunlight. Almost impossible to read through the dark magnifying portion of the lens.,3
I had planned on wearing these glasses only for looking at the GPS instruments in my airplaneThe glasses are as advertised but as I don't normally wear glasses I had to purchase a pair of glasses with no magnification to connect the flip glasses to. I find this uncomfortable to have to wear glasses all the time rather than only when needed.If possible I would like to order a pair of flip down glasses of the same 2.5 power that connect to the peak of a baseball style cap.Please let me know if you have a product like this in stock.ThanksRobert Moran,3
"They are OK (lenses are reasonable quality), but I managed to break the clasp on the first day. My fault, but ....",3
They were cheap but not very helpful,3
"I love this idea and use these glasses, but this is the 4th set I've owned because the batter flaps are flimsy and they break easily. These are pricy for that sort of failure, but there are incredibly useful, so I keep buying them despite their high failure rate. I gotta say, as soon as I find a more durable set of reading specs with lights I'll switch to those. These are cheaply made.",3
"Well first off I am NOT impressed by the packaging. Mine arrived wrapped in bubble wrap taped up so tightly that they had to be cut open. I was so worried I was going to cut the glasses and I came VERY close to getting the cord. Glasses are not as bright as I was hoping for/expected. Glasses are not as crisp as expected.However, they do work well for the price. I highly recommend upgrading packaging. I would give you an extra star if ANY of the above were better. But it would be too much effort to return them at this point. <shrug>",3
Nice glasses but too expensive,3
"I suppose you get what you pay for. I can use them as an extra pair but I would never order them again. I thought they were an ""oversized"" style.... they were listed as an oversized. But they're not. I like the color but that's about it.",3
These readers are light and comfortable but not meant for people who are rough on glasses. I love they are frameless but not sturdy enough for me,3
Bend easily,3
I like the sunglasses one the most because when looking at my phone in the sun I could actually see it.,3
I've been wearing progressive lenses for 30+ years. These are not progressives and I was unable to adjust.,3
"These progressive lenses really work well, but after 4 months 2 pairs (of the 3 in the order) have already broken. I've just received the second order and we'll see how long they last.",3
"I was so excited when I saw these. I spend my day swapping between .75, 1.0, (computer screens) 1.25 and 1.50 (on the work floor, First Aid applications). I also use a 2.50 for tiny work but I don't wear them regularly. I'm an EH&S manager so I'm always changing safety glasses depending on the situation with which I have to contend and most of my glasses are ANZI diopters. I thought these might be perfect for office work.These are so close but the focal length is strange. I ordered the 1.5's thinking the 1.5 would be on the bottom and digress as your eyes moved up the lens. The top part of the glasses is about a .5. I'm not sure what the middle is but I suspect it's supposed to be somewhere between a .75 to and 1. I find myself nodding up-and-down and moving back-and-forth trying to find the prefect spot for what I am doing. Even still, I can't seem to get a clear picture and the computer font can look doubled.I'm typing on my PC now (obviously) and I've just reverted back to my trusty, basic 1.0's, positioned close to the end of my nose and do the over-the-top-of-the-fame-peek when someone comes to the door.",3
"I thought they might be ""do-all"" driving glasses (distance, GPS, distance, GPS) but the grading is pretty steep so you only can use a fraction of the overall aperture for any particular thing.Oh, well. It was an idea.",3
This isn’t their fault but I was hoping to switch the prism to look up and they're firmly attached.,3
"These glasses work awesome and I wish I could have kept them. Unfortunately I have a small face and a small nose and they just kept sliding off, especially as they are on the heavy side. They did fit my step dad so they would work for some people.",3
"Not as I expected, I ordered this after reading the reviews, awful for reading.",3
Because I have cataract surgery I have new lenses in my eyes when I looked through the upper part of the glass it’s blurry I presume it’s because my lenses work better than the lenses in the glasses,3
"Basically, they took sunglasses and pasted on a little corner of bifocal. Talk about disappointing don’t waste your money.",3
Very cute but very cheap plastic.,3
This item is inferior to two SAV Sportex readers I have previously acquired. It is much less substantial with the thickest part of the frame half the size of my previous Sportex glasses. It doesn’t fit comfortably. Always feels like it is ready to fall off. Previous glasses were so comfortable it was possible to forget you were wearing them. I can’t recommend the current version of this product. Fortunately I still have one of the good Sportex glasses.,3
I've bought these before from my pharmacy and was very happy with them . These though are very flimsy in the ear area.. they cheapened them ...,3
"Not sure if its just my small head...but these are sturdy yes, which makes them hard. not flimsy glasses. They are snug on the nose and behind the ears...well more so ontop of the ears where they lay tends to be uncomfortable after a while. same with the nose piece. Other than that these are great for when you're laying down and want to read and not strain your neck",3
They a really cute bifocals but the do not darken in the sun.,3
"My first pair lasted a year when it unexpectedly broke, I had really liked them, so I bought a 2nd pair to replace it. THAT pair lasted only 5 months, when the frame broke in EXACTLY the same spot. But then the company sent we a replacement for free, so we'll see how this pair lasts.",3
"Lightweight and comfortable, but break easily. That said, its almost impossible to scratch them. I've bought multiple pairs because I keep breaking them, but I still go back to them because of its other good qualities.",3
"It seems like a better solution, right? You don't have to have a pointy 60-lb metal object hanging out your window. Easy to roll around etc.But it's not a better solution.1. In order to blow hot air out the window, the air has to come from somewhere. It's called negative pressure. This AC sucks air in from other rooms, from around your door frames etc. Warm air. So while it's cooling your room, it's also sucking warm air in from the rest of your house.2. The condenser condenses water. Unless you locate it near a drain, a unit like this has nowhere to send the water--so it just puts it back into the air. So you get a very MOIST environment. Like water is condensing on the unit and making little puddles.3. The compressor is noisy--and now it's inside your room rather than hanging out the window.4. It takes up valuable floor space.I suppose this unit is fine for what it is. But a good window unit will beat it 10 days out of 10.",3
"This works well as a fan, but is actually quite loud even on the lowest setting.The cool setting uses the water in the basin, which is terribly difficult to fill, since no funnel is offered and the fill spot is way at the bottom, inside a panel, which is also a bit tough to remove. Try that with a gallon jug.It got so thick in the air, with moisture, but didn't especially cool the place off. The only saving grace was the direct fan. Honestly.",3
"At this price point it’s not worth it. I mean, the fan is not bad, the water makes the air coming out cooler, but it won’t cool down the room and lower the temperature. It even says on the box that it won’t make your room cooler. It’s just a strong winded, loud (!) fan that is nice as long as you’re right in front of it. On hot days when we put it in our bedroom and close the door it’s like walking into a humid hot pool house a couple hours later. Oh! And it makes screeching sounds when it reaches lower water levels so you don’t get the stated hours of use out of it. Buy a cheaper fan, this ain’t worth it.",3
"THE GOOD: The front grid is more solid than the previous model. If you fill it with Ice and Water, it does help to cool....but only if you add ice. If you just fill with water it is no better than a fan. It is a nice looking unit. THE BAD: The power cord is much shorter than the previous model, which is a problem. The remote is flimsy, cheap, doesn't work that well and is really difficult to open. Once you do open it, you will find it needs one of those round, Quarter size batteries (which, of course, is not included). This model doesn't beep when the water level is getting low. There is no warning system. You have to unscrew the back of the unit in order to clean the filter. With the previous model you could just slide the filter out to clean it.",3
"It cools, but noisy when compressor running, no noise insulation at all, vibration cause plastic housing more noise. window seal kit has uneven height, need extra thick rubber tapes to help sealing air gaps.",3
"large, loud, more like a big expensive fan, only cools if standing in front of it, my apartment is 700 sq feet and it does not cool to the level I would hope for, also it increases humidity which leads to mugginess and further sweating in heat, returning",3
Be aware this unit ships only with a US plug and you will require a converter if you want to use it in the UK. This information is not supplied by the seller.,3
Not sure why the funnel keeps disconnecting from the unit. Highly annoying. It's loud but cools the area well.,3
"First allow me to say what the headline clearly states: This is not an air conditioner in any way, shape, or form. If you are seeking something that is going to cool a room down, this is not the product that is going to miraculously do that for you. In fact, I have searched high and low for a product that was like that only to realize that such things don't exist unless you have a window unit or a the very least a window for ventilation tubing that connects to a true portable AC unit.However, as a simple little desktop fan, it's not bad. I don't think it is worth the cost, nor do I believe in all the hype this product received when it became available. But it isn't terrible. I could have bought something far cheaper and probably received a product that did the same thing. I would also like to note, that when I first received the item, it was defective, and I had to return it for a replacement. Still, I do think it is decent for what it is. And when compared to a regular fan of the same size, the water and filter aspect of this will give you a cooler breeze, just not a life changing one.",3
"Small but kind of powerful. This fan indoors gets really cool and does a good job cooling off. However we took this outdoors to my son's soccer game and it didn't live up to the hype as much. It did provide airflow as if it was slightly windy, however it wasn't able to get cool. Please note I have not tried with ice or water yet. For that reason I'm giving it 3 stars. But as for being able to take it remotely anywhere you think you may be hot, this is great to move wherever. Charging does take 6 hours, best to do overnight.",3
"Given time, this unit will definitely cool down a room, the difference between the temperature is noticeable, and if you let it run for multiple hours without stopping, it will get noticeably chilly even. It does work, but that being said, the unit is INCREDIBLY loud. I have to turn my phone volume to near maximum in order to hear anything. The loudness is in fact so bothering that It becomes complicated to watch tv without worrying that the volume of the tv will bother the downstairs neighbors. This can be remedied by investing in noise cancelling headphones, but I wish it could be quieter, sleep mode does not make a difference in sound level. Installation was complicated, I had to modify the panel by cutting part of it off in order for it to fit my window, after which it left a jagged looking edge on the panel. The hose was easy to put on and install. The remote control feels relatively cheap, but it does indeed perform its intended function. The unit is fairly compact all things considered. The fan speed is okay, but nothing incredibly impressive. I will note that the fan sometimes sounds like it’s scraping. Overall the unit will cool your room to a comfortable level, but you should expect this unit to have noticeable problems. (Auto evaporation function works, review based on mid 80s to low 90s weather) I will say that I expected more from this, it exudes a very cheap vibe. This is a very good example of “you get what you pay for” I would urge anyone looking at this to explore better options before you find yourself wanting something better.",3
"Not exactly what was to be expected for the money it costs, definitely removes humidity but not so much an air cooler",3
High powered fan at best definitely not going to cool off a room...cools off the direct few feet in front of where it's blowing... a little louder than expected but not unbearable.Update: This also leaks a massive amount of water. If leaving on over night it will fill at minimum a 3 gal. Bucket with water,3
"It works great! However, it is IMPERATIVE to note the very high noise it makes. If you sleep in a small room and use this, you won't be able to use it at night because of how loud it is. Otherwise, nothing bad to say about it, great for the pric",3
"Love, my DREO oil filled radiator heater. Swamp cooler works well. However, it has a small water capacity. You need to refill water and change ice two or three times a day depending on the temperature & your settings. Water tank is difficult to disconnect & reconnect. So I bring water to the cooler in bottles. Somewhat high maintenance. Cools one small room 5 to 10° depending. Probably best to supplement a window or central AC. Handsome and slim design with a small footprint. Multiple settings.",3
"It's ok. it doesn't cool off the room as it says it does and I have a pretty small room. I have to add ice to the bucket to even feel cool air and I have to place it very close to my bed so I can feel the cool air. When the ice melts and water is no longer cold; it's not as cool. At the end of the day it does work, but with a few adjustments.",3
Couldn't cool down a small tent,3
"This portable evap cooler did little to help during this 110-degree summer, the continuous fill option might be the better way to make use of it. The wheels at the base make it extremely easy to move into the room where it is needed and it is extremely easy to use with only the water reservoir and the fan level you want to place it on. However, the cooling power itself leaves something to be desired.",3
"Unless you can put it in front of a window or a source of dry air and have a door open on the other side of the room, it is just a big humidifier.It needs to work like a dairy barn. Fan pulls Outside air in though the pad and into the room.Only difference is the fan is on the other end of the dairy barn exhausting and pulling outside air through through the pad.not blowing into the barn.If it just circulated inside air though the pad it wouldn’t cool and if there was no exhaust it would be a soupy mess lol. If the air going thru the pad is not dry and it’s humid then there will be little to no evaporation occurring on the pad and thus no evaporative cooling effectIf you’re in a dry place this will come in handy don’t need anything there just turn it on.",3
The media could not be loaded. This is a good fan to sit on your desk. Even with ice in the reservoir it doesn't get really cold. It's not meant to cool an entire room. But it's good as a personal fan.,3
Have to have it plugged up to use and would not work with another cord I had it only worked with the original cord,3
"While this is a less expensive option, it emits a great deal of noise especially in a small room. If it weren't such a hassle and drain on the planet, we would return. It cools our room fine (300 square feet) and was easy to assemble. But it is in my office and I must turn off to answer the phone. It is a background hum, but loud. So much for, you get what you pay for. Otherwise fine.",3
The product worked really well but I only had this air cooler for two weeks and the filter smelled a little fishy and I cleaned it but it still smell a bit,3
Bottom vents are not open and only for show. Hard to remove bottom water tray to clean. Seems to get slimy even when using distilled water. Cools somewhat but not great. Fan is quite noisy.,3
"Had the product for over 1 yr and ready to throw it out. It worked great at first, though some times it felt like the compressor was going out. Now it cannot even cool the one room its supposed to. It is set to 70, and the room is still near 80.",3
It doesn't blow alot of air,3
The media could not be loaded. You have to keep water in the tank for any cool air to blow out then when it runs out it will make a loud noise so you know it’s out of water and it’s just a regular fan. Not worth the money if you ask me. But I guess it works some what.,3
"I got this at a really good price to keep my room cool in the summer. So far, it's working alright - However the ""evaporative cooling"" does not keep up at all. I've had to use the included drain to drain it out the window - and let me tell you, that plug is situated an inch off the ground. Makes it really hard to empty it, it should be situated higher!Standard issues with the single hose setup - it creates negative air pressure in the room which draws in hot air, and the cold air from the bedroom the machine uses is quite counterintuitive.However, the power usage seems to be optimal, and for that I'll give it a solid 3 stars.",3
"Had hoped this would actually cool the air, but in Chicago on a normal summer day, the humidity is too high for it to work. Might work in low humidity environments. I don't know. Otherwise, quiet enough for white noise to sleep with, although noisier than a $20 table fan if you want to watch TV. Wouldn't have bought it if I'd read or thought about the description more carefully. Description as an air conditioner is somewhat misleading, as even with the ice packs, it had no effect on a small room.",3
During the day when it's really hot it doesn't cool to much but at night it does work really good.,3
"Great for spot cooling, i wish i had known that the watertank is not removable.its almost impossible to clean the tank except for rinsing it and letting it drain via the drainplug.Also,no mentioning in the instructions if the watercurtain can be replaced.If you have hard water definitely add a water treatment.Its a nuce unit otherwise.",3
It works more like a fan than air conditioner. When you put the ice in it is cold for a half hour than works more like a fan. Should have spent more money and got a window air unit.,3
"Ordered 8/11/2024, this product was good and served the purpose, however,it ran fine until yesterday and no mist/fan shut off now. I would expect the quality shall be at least last passing 1+ year or last even longer like some other brands I used. 3 star as neutral.",3
"**UPDATE** It stopped working after a year. It was used daily, but only for maybe fifteen minutes a day. it worked great, but it didn't last long at all.This has been absolutely wonderful since day one. The unit is quiet, much quieter than the standard window air conditioner, and is super easy to move from room to room. The outflow of air is just right and is enhanced by the oscillating feature. It's not an eyesore or difficult to operate. It has a convenient feature in which it beeps to let you know that the water level is too low to use with the cool feature.",3
"Item is okay, but little heavy and little big for us. Sounds okay for low volume, little noise for high volume, new start to use has some plastic smell because it made by heavy duty plastic, but after blow out for a while before use, smell is away. Worked as a cooler and big fan, so far I grade it 3 to 4 star max.",3
"It took a long time for this to ship, the box was beat up when it arrived but the contents seemed ok. While waiting for it to ship I purchased and used the 10,000 BTU version of this air conditioner from another store (it’s ultimate destination to a bedroom). The 10,000 version was easy to put together (once I figured out the top of the box lifts off the packaging after you cut the straps) and worked well cooling the area. The 14,000 version is a bit bigger, was difficult to wrangle the hose (kept unlocking and detaching one side or another and popping out of the brackets all together). And really was disappointing as it works nowhere near as well as the 10,000 did in the same area. I had high hopes, more power would equate to better cooling. I’ll keep using it to see if it gets any better and update if it does (especially since it would be hard to wrangle, repackage and return). This was definitely a case of more power being no better. Also I do agree the dry mode tends to feel cooler than the actual AC mode and is better at cooling a larger area.",3
The fan gives pretty good air flow but the cooling part doesnt really do much! Not that much of a difference with or without ice! Good fan not a good air conditioner.,3
"It a fan.. nothing special.. blows air. The ice packs are pretty pointless. But it keeps you cool, I guess..",3
I have only used it a very short time and will try it again before I say if it can keep up with the heat and humidity.,3
"I have only had this a could of days and haven't decided if I will try to return this or not. It does a decent job of pushing out cool air if the ice packs are loaded. It is also compact and light weight and was easy to install. I use a humidifier at night, so this was a good way for me to get extra humidity in the house at the same time I'm cooling.The instructions are useless in telling you how to read the water level or how to remove the water tank to empty or clean it. Other reviews made me realize reading the water level is nearly impossible - so you just guess when you're filling it that you haven't overfilled. I still haven't figured out how to empty and/or clean the water tank. Also, several other reviews say it leaks and I just installed new wood flooring, so I'll have to buy a tray to put it on if I keep it. Hmmm...",3
"I bought this for my bedroom/office. Room is 11 x 11 and houses 2 computers and 4 monitors so it does run warmer than it should. This lil guy was so great out the gate back in the spring when I got it. Unfortunately it is now struggling mightily. Set at 22---celsius I think, which is 72 according to google. I'm sitting right in front of it sweating. No way is my room 72. 82 degrees MAYBE. Which is better than the current 99 outside in TX. Every half hour or so it has a mini heart attack and shudders hard enough to rattle my window/floor. It's not so bad when it doesn't wake me up at night. I really wanted this to be better. But I may be asking too much.",3
Loading from the top takes a long time to fill. The ice packs do little to chill the water as it passes over them so quickly Not to bad otherwise. Decent fan speeds and semi compact size,3
"The Dial 3-Speed Portable Evaporative Cooler is decent for cooling smaller spaces up to 500 sqft. The 1300 CFM airflow is adequate, and the three-speed settings offer some flexibility. However, I found it to be a bit noisy at higher speeds, which can be distracting. Additionally, the cooling performance is just average, especially on really hot days. It's a good option if you need a portable cooler, but don't expect it to replace an air conditioner.",3
"The size is great, but it doesn't blow enough cold air to keep a small room cool. I bought this a/c for my garage but is not what I expected.",3
"I bought these so that I would not have headphone hair whenever I play video games and plan on going out later. They work great and have good sound quality when they are snug in your ear. However, these tend to come loose from your ear with any minor movement that you make and after about 20 minutes of use, the band that goes over your ear starts to dig in and hurt. Overall, I would not really recommend these. I would rather spend a bit more to get something a bit more comfortable and better sounding such as the Razer Hammerhead Duo.",3
"Headset was renewed so about 60% price of new. Headset was kinda gross like it was just exposed in a warehouse, really would have taken little effort to wipe it with a cloth to make it presentable. Was dirty in the way a neglected tshirt in a warehouse might get (the fuzzy bits on the headband). Upon setting the device up the sound quality leaves a bit to be desired; directly comparing it to the same device utilized with the same hardware setup previously. I bought this because I lost the wireless dongle (found outjust 5 minutes ago logitech sells this replacement piece for $15 - so I sort of paid 3x as much given I didn't need the headset or charging cable which is my mistake -. Some of the sound is bad when the headset is trying to recreate a specific audio range, there is no interference or anything conflicting. Sound in general is worse than the sound from my monitor. 3/5, should be a 4/5 product had it before better sound",3
So the stand is cool. Serves its purpose. But the pole just sits on top of a post in the base. The pole is too wide so it leans. The top plate also is flimsy and sits crooked and spins when you barely touch it.The lights are neat and that it has 2 USB ports but I wouldn't get it again.,3
"These sound absolutely amazing, they are also loud yet crystal clear I love the sound! Now there is two core things to headphones for me, sound and comfortability. Sound is amazing but comfort it lacks heavily for me. I may have bigger ears or something but no matter what adjustments I make, they always feel uncomfortable to my ears, the originals never did that to my ears before so I don't know what's up. They just aren't very comfortable but everyone's head/ears are different so it may not work for me but great for you!",3
"The headset sounds good and all but in order to get the best out of it you have to use razer's software... which crashes all the time, is often slow to respond, and all around just a nightmare to deal with on the side.If you're ok with some of your features being locked behind a barely useable piece of software then it's a good headset. If you want your full moneys worth, you'll want to look else where.",3
Not enough description and close up to see if it would fit,3
"I have owned 2 of these and 1 was lost neither has had functionality issuesPROS1.The functionality is more than sufficient and may be better than OEM. It still works well when out of comfortable position.2. The price point is OK, I really feel it shouldn't be over $10 maybe $93. Durability is Solid!CONS1. The over-long boom (neck that mic sits on)2. The fit SUCKS!!!!! It needs frequent (near constant if you can't get the sweet-spot) repositioning for stability. It caneasily fall out of the headset when placed down flat or not on your head walking around.I would rate 4*If they dropped the price for the performance5* (at current price point $12)If they fixed the fit/stability issues (reduced boom length1.5-2""/reduced weight is likely all that's needed)",3
These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. They have great sound and they are comfortable for many hours at a time. The microphone works great. BUT. The pads fall apart after just a few months. They also come off the headphones entirely.,3
"I like Rig headsets, their durable and comfortable. They also give great sound quality. My old one recently got the charger stuck in it causing me to buy a new one. This would looked great and was cheaper than the one I recently had. I ordered it and when I received it I started to set it up. However, this type of headset does not connect to consoles. In the video they show it does but they use a different usb drive. The one they send you does not come with a option to switch it to gaming. Headset still works perfectly but for pc, not my xbox. Gonna have to send it back and get a new one. Please double check that it is compatible with console before buying, big mistake I made",3
"Product was good but after a week it started disconnecting randomly. Assistance was good but for returns,it costs me 45$ to send it back for refund or replacement so I guess I’ll just try to repair it myself instead of throwing my money out the window",3
If you have a Dual Sense Edge this stand will NOT work for charging your controller. Just an FYI. Other than that it’s solid.,3
"Ok headphone stand for the price, however It had a strong plastic like scent. Overall does its job.",3
"I put a picture cause idk what this part is called, but it just shocked me when I went to move the cord and touched one of the screws. The audio and mic quality are better than expected, it kind of hurts my ears after 30 mins of wearing them. Overall not bad for the money, I've had these for about a year now.Honestly if I could go back I would get a different product. Anyways.. if anyone wants a HEAVILY discounted pink pair of these let me know! I don't want these suckers anymore, wireless ftw",3
"I bought this back in the end of February, opened it and used it a few times. Only for listening though. To which this headset has very good sound and clarity. Its also very comfortable for being on the bottom tier of gaming headsets.Unfortunately I never ended up using the microphone which is a plug in until about a month later. Come to find out it was dead or the connection to the 3.5mm jack is bad. Have not been able to determine which it is. Sadly its now just a nice headset for listening to music. My Rub here was that I tried to ask for a replacement, not a refund and I'm 3 days past the return date. While that is mostly on me for not checking this sooner, something like this that was purchased relatively recently should have still been able to be replaced since a major component was defective.",3
"The Xbox turns on and seems to work fine, but the controller doesn't turn on at all.",3
It works plays the games but it does like to turn on its own when not it use. Has turned off on its own while using it but not when playing a game.other than that works great,3
The regular power cord did not work thankfully I had another one from my previous Xbox 360. So no return was needed. It did not come with a cord charger for the remote but I still made it work.,3
Really cute. I had to pry the beak open a little so it would work with normal toothpicks. A cute gimmick.,3
Not as fluffy as pictured. A little disappointed but think it will still work for what was needed.,3
"The placemats are super thin which is why I only gave them 3 stars. They look nice and price is good, but they tear easily.",3
Very light can get blown away quickly. I thought it was hard paper but it's very cheap paper. Size was okay. It seems like they just printed with color ink on it.,3
Get alot of placemats for the money.,3
Too many colors. Blue should be water only. Is Switzerland in Italy and Austria? Is Russia in Europe and Asia. What devides Russia and Asia.I like the pads. They don’t fold or tear. Easy to read.,3
"These are cute, but they are too small. You’ll see in the pictures of dinner plate covers most of it, a dessert plate leaves some exposed and it’s cute. There made of good enough material, easy to wash strong enough that they won’t bend and fold if you’re careful with them. If I had bought them at Walmart. I would probably return them. But I don’t believe it to be the Sellers problem. I’m sure that they provided measurements and I just didn’t pay attention because I thought they were so cute.",3
They are bright but I used one outside as a decorative center piece on the glass table on my deck and in a week it faded. Very disappointed.,3
great quality but ours came with a little warp in the middle of them all,3
"Well, I ordered 4 packs of these placemats. Not what I expected. I was hoping they were a thicker, padded mat but they were just flat vinyl. I feel they were pretty expensive for what you get...",3
I didn't realize these placemats are not what I expected. I thought they're harder but they're just too bendable or foldable.,3
"Nice pattern but very thin,",3
"These placemats have a lovely print but they are very thin, similar to table napkins.",3
The feel cheap and flimsy but get the job done.,3
Great when it worked but broke after about 100 toothpicks,3
"First the good: I received my Chromebook in excellent condition! Considering its age, it looked like new and has great performance. Not one scratch or blemish on it. 2 in 1 touch screen works perfectly. No issues with hinges when placing it in tablet mode. All keys worked. Not mentioned on product page is that it had 4 ports (2 USB C style and 2 older style) and a micro SD slot. All of which work fine. Now the bad and my only complaint: The product page list this Chromebook as being released on 6/16/2022. I purchased this Chromebook based on this information. When I first turned it on, I checked through OS settings and saw that the Auto Update Expiration date is 6/2027. Only 3 years from now. Upon further investigation, I found out that this device was released in 6/2018. IMO, This is very DECEPTIVE!! I purchased this item based on the listed release date on the product page. If I had known it was 2018, I would have purchased a newer, i.e., 2020, renewed Chromebook I saw out there. Lesson learned for me. I would have given this product 5 stars, it really is in excellent condition, but due to the deception, I am knocking it down to 3, and debating whether to keep it or return it. I also wasn’t pleased that a few hours after ordering the Chromebook, all of a sudden it was around $10 cheaper than what I paid for it. Then the next day it was back to around what I paid for it.If you are OK with a Chromebook that will receive OS updates for only 3 more years, then by all means purchase this one. New Chromebooks with 2 in 1 screens are not cheap. The one I received really is in great condition. Maybe I’ll just buy a used one every 3 years.",3
"The thing runs good enough for my school work. It came in pretty poor condition and had a stupid sticker covering the scratches. The stylus was not included and the charger for it was ripped out of the machine. It was legit glued together 🤦. I cant complain though, it was $100 and can browse the web.",3
"The computer seems fine, but the product description says this is a touchscreen and it's not",3
"The product is an attractive, utile piece of hardware, albeit one that is at times distractingly low-fidelity. It is sensibly priced for its modest specifications, however, and makes for a perfectly reasonable piece of equipment in the hands of someone who wants only for functional, uncomplicated tools. For such people, I am sure you will not be dissatisfied, but it is possible you will find better bargains for technology of this caliber elsewhere.",3
"11.024...I am an email, platform / charting user. big improvment from my 5 yr old HPlike: quick start up (dump edge and bing and it will be better)...key spacing good for my stumpy fingers...touch screen good... overall performance works for medislike: POOR BATTERY LIFE -4+ hrs continuous use, set to optimize performance...needs a newer mag-set power plug (the 3.5mm's stick out and are a hazard).. 256 memory is minimal (I knew this going in) and I find the SD slot card protrudes to far out.recommend you look for a similar deal but with a better battery, more memory or a better slot.",3
"I purchased this HP Chromebook 14"" G5 hoping for a simple and lightweight laptop to handle basic tasks like browsing the web, checking emails, and streaming videos. While it performs well for those tasks, I was disappointed with its speed. The Intel Celeron N3350 processor is simply not powerful enough for multitasking or more demanding applications. Unfortunately, this limitation wasn’t clearly stated in the product description, which could mislead potential buyers looking for a faster device.That being said, there are some positives worth mentioning. The Chromebook’s design is sleek and lightweight, making it easy to carry around. The 14-inch screen is bright and offers good resolution for watching videos, and the keyboard is comfortable for typing. Additionally, the device arrived in excellent condition, and for a renewed product, it looks brand new.If you’re looking for a budget-friendly laptop for very basic use, this could work for you. However, if speed and performance are important, I’d recommend exploring other options.",3
Very misleading! I needed a laptop for school and to be touchscreen. This one was on the Black Friday sale and it clearly states touchscreen. It is NOT touchscreen.,3
I don’t like how fast the battery life goes down. For example I charged it all while I was at church and i got on it to send a email and it said it was on 16 percent.,3
"If you're gonnaa use this laptop for anything other than doing homework, you're all set but if you stream, multitask, make music, play game; the lag is, not even exaggerating, unbearable.",3
"Was for my 11 year old and his school work, does what it's supposed to but the screen is sub par",3
Do not use Combination Studios as seller for this laptop. They shipped a defective product which appears to have been a retuned item. Lenovo claimed my recent purchase was for an item sold months earlier and it was out of warranty.,3
I ordered this pc and I got it early. It works but it won't hold a charge. I'm going to send it back and get a new one. It takes a while to set up so that sucks i have to do that again. but i need it to charge. i dont want to be stuck with the cord all the time. sometimes i gotta move with the pc.,3
"This is a good little computer and it's an annoying little computer. It is good that it is light weight and easily slips into a knapsack with no noticeable weight increase. Watch the battery life, it drains rather quickly and is slow to charge. The unit also cannot be used at night, unless, and this is a big unless, you are a master of the keyboard. The reason I say this is because the keys do not light up. That is a big deal to me, because my last little laptop key's lit up and I could continue to work into the night.Perhaps this is a new feature, or I haven't figured out how to fix it, but the icons line up on the left side of the screen and do not save. Meaning, every time I want to go to Google, I have to manually type it in. I set Google as my default search screen and it always defaults to Bing, another thing I do not like.So, in the end, I believe this was a get what I pay for system. It's good in that it's light weight, the processing speed is awesome, but that could be my internet provider. I do not like how the websites that I go to on a daily basis do not save on a top rack that I can just click on. The keys do not light up and that is a big downer for me.2.5 stars for this unit, but I gave it three, because it really is a solid little computer, the set up is just not to my personal liking.",3
"This Chromebook unit was refurbished. Paid $99. There is a vinyl sheet glued to the top so I suspect the top was scratched or badly worn. The edge of the sheet is peeling.The unit did not come with a charging cord so I called Amazon and they shipped a power cord a few days later. This unit has two USB ports and one HDMI port. Also has a port for a micro disc. The key pad has a mouse touch pad but I use one USB port for a wireless mouse, The unit is working properly.Chromebooks offer a good option for school work and new users to computers. The 11.5 screen is adequate and the operating system if fine for web browsing . There are several system applications and more can be downloaded from Google Play, much like an Android phone.The Docs app can be used to write letters, The Sheets app is for spreadsheets. Also has a camera for virtual meetings.Not a good unit for gamers. Similar to using your smartphone. Connect to internet using Bluetooth or tether to your phone.",3
"The pictures for this chromebook show it, a nexstand, a mouse, and a bag. The only items in the box were the chromebook and charger. This is false advertising. Other than that the chromebook arrived in perfect condition and is super fast. It was also advertised as touch screen and it most definitely is not.",3
"Cute and does what I need it to do. Its a bit slow, but I wasnt looking for speed...I wanted something that did the basics and had memory all for a bargain. My 1 complaint is the battery. Im used to my battery holding a full charge if the laptop sits unused a couple days. This one doesnt hold its charge very well. Dont get me wrong, it has a standard battery life when im using it.",3
"Functions as I need it EXCEPT battery only lasts about an hour. If it is plugged in, no issues. Not sure if is the model or just a crappy battery included with Amazon's refurbishment.",3
"Pretty fast laptop in great condition, only issue is it has an American keyboard. As and when I need to type a £ sign I may struggle. Why sell a laptop with an American keyboard in England? Baffling.",3
"I like this computer overall MINUS the camera glitch. I purchased this elitebook because I was looking for a budget friendly personal laptop. I have used a similar elitebook at my job, and it performed just fine. So, I figured why not. One con is that it is a bit heavy compared to the other elitebook I am accustomed to (don’t remember which specific one, sorry). This is minor.HOWEVER… I do a lot of work from my computer, including work that requires my presence on zoom and other video call softwares. Therefore I MUST have a laptop with a properly functioning camera. I contacted Amazon support and their troubleshooting method did not work. I contacted HP, downloaded several updates both on the computer system itself as well as the updates offered through the HP Assistant. Restarted several times. Camera still does not work.I am SO DISAPPOINTED ☹️.",3
the laptop arrived wtih part of the chassis broken off.,3
"I’ve had this computer for about 3 weeks now and the exterior and condition of the laptop is great but I’ve noticed it does not keep a charge for more than 3hrs. I will have it at a full 100% and quickly starts to die if I don’t have it plugged in constantly. A few of the keys are worn out so you have to push them with more force than others. May seem like a minor issue but leads to a lot of autocorrection needed which is not ideal for those who write lengthy assignments. The sound quality also is diminished once it’s turned up over 70%, it starts to sound as if part of the speaker is blown. The last issue is the speed of the computer is not nearly as fast as my previous Mac which is actually older than this model. I definitely want to return this product but can’t afford to wait over a week for a replacement.",3
The media could not be loaded. Hello laptop battery Life not good only 3.5 approx. Window 11 pro not licensed product. I want product key for windows 11 pro. Pls let me know,3
"The product has discoloration and external scratches. Also, some keys on the keyboard do not work properly.",3
"The computer is very very nice, It had everything but the fingerprint reader which is mainly why I ordered it. It was suppose to be a special feature that was in the description on the item. Amazon has contacted the seller just waiting for a response to get it straightened out.",3
"Unfortunately, this was one of those purchases where the negatives out weighed the positives. The positives are that it's a working lap top for 80 bucks and it's a Chromebook, so it will probably keep working. The negatives were: (a) the enclosed power cord was so wrong for the computer that it wouldn't even plug and I had to order a new one; (b) it was advertised as a 2020 model and the sticker on the back plainly says 2019. This matters with a Chromebook because they have updates for a limited number of years and once the updates are over, so is the computer. So, this effectively knocked a year of usage off the laptop. Finally, the screen of the computer very definitely does NOT fold over as shown in the pictures - it's a standard 45 degree hinge. I've been very pleased with refurbished electronics on Amazon in the past and consider them a wonderful deal. The quality control from this company, however, is either incredibly poor or just plain fraudulent. Not worth the hassle of returning, but very definitely not satisfactory.",3
"I bought this renewed Dell Latitude on July 20th, 2024. At first, I noticed that some of the keys need to be pressed harder than others, but everything else seemed to be working fine. So, I adjusted my typing to be more firm. Now, I'm having issues with the monitor flickering occasionally, sometimes for 5-10 seconds at a time, and I can't read what's on the screen. I've made sure to update all of the software and drivers, but it still has issues.",3
"We used this device for YouTube, google docs, kids’ school and email. It did what we needed it to for a great price. It came with a junky charging cord that needed to be replaced right away, but that was still under warranty. I purchased it in July ‘22 and now March ‘24 it died. It was inconvenient to wait for a new charging cord and 2 different batteries as I tried to trouble shoot it. Nothing has worked to power it on, and I am not paying asus to fix it as their warranty was less than a year.",3
I returned it! It was too far behind in the past.,3
Mine snapped not even a month into owning it.,3
"We bought this Chromebook, just to run an app for a Smartboard for my wife's classroom.The unit was nice and clean, ran the Smartboard fine, and we were happy with the price. After about 2 weeks, one of the shift keys stopped working. We asked for an exchange, and got a 2nd unit. This one had issues right out of the box. The scroll pad, just does not respond correctly. Also, the Smartboard won't fully function with this unit.We were going to get a 3rd unit, but you can't, until the others are returned. But my wife is at least getting by with the original, until we get a fully working replacement. We decided to try a refurbished HP Chromebook, and are going to return the two Dells for a refund.",3
I ordered 4 of these. They shipped quickly and chromebooks work well. My kids are homeschooled and they needed them for their schoolwork. One of the chargers came with frayed wires and won't charge. I contacted seller about getting it replaced and never heard back. Kids are sharing which is annoying.,3
"don't get me wrong the computer is in great condition. its fast and does everything i need it to do..but when setting it up everything was in chinese..EVERYTHING and it took 2 hours for me to get back to normal and then i realized i received a MacBook with some chinese keys on it. the caps lock button is in chinese and the ""enter"" button doesnt even have words on it so that was very inconvenient makes me feel like i have a fake. and I'm scared to get a replacement cause i don't wanna get one with the correct keys but a worse computer compared to this one",3
"not so pleased, it does not hold the battery long enough , ended up using my old laptop instead and later bought a new apple laptop, because, just not pleased with the features and the speed",3
Very bad battery,3
"What I really liked was it arrived on time and package was very neat and boxed just perfect. One small thing, not really much to complain about, but after ordering an Intel i5 cpu, which I really thought was swell, I opened the neat brown box and slid the shiny new laptop out, opened the lid and saw it was actually an AMD Ryzen cpu, which are really good, but not an intel i5. So I reluctanty got them to send me RMA for return. Seller was very happy to help me.",3
"It works like a charm. However, the hinge cover thingy was missing leaving the hinges and the display wires vulnerable. It also came with some slightly visible surface damages near the edges. Overall from the performance side, it's great. From the visuals side, it's meeeeh....fine.Edit: -1 star because I found that it couldn't handle basic chrome tabs load, it would start to freeze or act slow.",3
"The screen is totally washed out and faded. It works fine but the screen gets me everytime - all colors are washed out with a blue tint. Otherwise, it has handled being hooked up to an external monitor and speakers, extra USB hub. I used it as an interim computer so I was doing tons of computer searching, emails, and a bit of a 5D planning website that I use for work. It kept up well.",3
Didn't work upon delivery. I returned it,3
"NB the documentation does not say this, but the pen actually works better if you use it in the stand.The device is very light. It feels flimsy, but maybe the light weigh is good as it may be easier on the handI was interested in this, because the previous mouse I was using was irritating the arthritis in my right thumb. I am hoping this will be better, but it might be too soon to tell. In any case, it's generally better to switch up hand positions to relieve repetitive use injuries.It did not come with a battery. The battery cover was hard to remove. I had a friction sheet that I use for opening jars. That helped me open the battery cover.The battery was hard to get in, but eventually I did.At first the laptop did not recognize the clicks on this mouse -- but then it seemed to figure it out. Maybe there's a learning curve -- not sure.Otherwise it seems to work.I'll have to get back to this review after I see whether it helps my hand feel betterOne disadvantage is that I use the mouse on a pull out drawer, below the surface of my workstation. This device is too tall to stay on the drawer when I close it.-----------------I've been using it for 2 days now. I've knocked it on the floor at least 20 times during that time. So far, it's still working, but I wonder how long it can survive like this. A lot of times I accidentally knock it on the floor when I'm trying to reach for it. Other times, it's because I forget it's there. It's very unstable.",3
"This review is for the Adesso iMouse S8. I was looking for the smallest wired mouse that still has a DPI switch button. I believe this is one of the only mice that fits into that category.The Adesso S8 is a small and light weight mouse with a retractable cord. It is very comfortable to use with my medium sized hands. I used a much smaller Verbatim Traveler mouse and it was just too difficult to control. I did notice less strain on my wrists and elbows with this mouse over other much larger mice that I have used in the past. However, this is a benefit based on the size class as opposed to this mouse in particular. I do have a few issues with the Adesso S8.The main problem I have with the Adesso S8 is the build quality. The Adesso is light because it is made out of very thin plastic with the inside having a lot of empty space. The retractable cord is thinner than any mouse cord that I have ever seen or used before. That might be acceptable if retracting the cord was not so tricky. Even the buttons and scroll wheel have that cheap feel to it. Some more metal or thicker plastic would have improved build quality and added some much needed heft to it. For me, the light weight makes it a bit difficult to control. Another thing is that I have seen other mice with a very similar design and look to this one. So, this is probably a generic mouse that Adesso just puts a name on.Overall, this is a comfortable mouse that actually has 4 DPI settings. I would prefer a mouse with a little more weight to it. I do not believe this mouse would last that long given its flimsy build quality. In the end the price does seem to match the quality of mouse that you get.Note: Amazon.com does not allow half ratings. But if I could I would give it 3.5 out of 5.",3
"I bought this one because every other mouse with a retractable cord is about the size of my fingernail.This one is a nice size but the cord doesn't retract as well as I'd like; it tends to be a hit or miss.But that is not why I docked it two stars..When using it, the cursor shakes uncontrollably on the screen... or just moves every which way, but the one in which I directed it to go.It was starting to feel like an out-of-control Ouija planchette.",3
"Some problems when first received - No instructions - Wire would retract and not stay at desired length. There is a switch for different sensitivities - but without instructions it is hard to know what the positions are. I went to the Adesso website, but could not find any explanation of the switch settings. After pulling the retractable wire in and out and playing with the wire retractor I was able to adjust the wire to the length I wanted - I don't know what I did to make it work correctly. The mouse is comfortable and is working OK. If more information had been available, I might have given it another star.",3
"I like this mouse and it works well. I just don't think a regular size mouse like this one should be on a retractable cable.I feel like I should have gotten the mini size mouse on a retractable cable. I say this because of the weight of a regular size mouse doesn't allow the cable to pull back together on its own. I have to monkey with it quite a bit to get it back together when I'm finished with it each time, which can get a bit aggravating sometimes. Unless paired with a stronger retractable cable, I would recommend the Mini size mouse because of this issue.",3
Its an OK retractable and good for travelling with a Laptop and not depending on bluetooth or battery. The problem with this mouse specifically that it works with blue led and not working on white surfaces.,3
"I bought this keyboard largely because of its backlit keys. It's good looking, ergonomic, smooth key function. It's a great keyboard with one glaring problem -- the battery dies very quickly. Even though I've started keeping it connected to a charger and turn it off when I'm not using it, the battery does seem to last more than a few hours at most. In fact, this morning when I turned if on it was already dead and it took a while to charge enough to connect to my Mac. The battery is a huge disappointment to what would otherwise be a great keyboard.",3
"bluetooth range is 1 and a half foot from my desktop, if i put the board closer to me but still on the desk, it looses bluetooth! cannot replace since it was a renewed and they don't have any more in inventory",3
"I love how small and portable this is, it folds up to a box a little bigger than my phone. But it feels kinda flimsy and is a little hard to pair.",3
"For it's price, it's a pretty decent Bluetooth keyboard. I got this one because it's so slim and fits easily with my smaller iPad Air. But some of the keys have an issue where if you press it once, it doesn't actually register and type the letter. Other keys if you press it once, the letter registers it twice and types it twice.A bit frustrating, but it was pretty cheap. I don't use it very often anymore though so I can't say how it's held up.",3
Not bad but feels kind of cheap not gonna lie. Concerner about longevity and sometimes the touchpad acts crazy in wireless mode when im not even far from the dongle.,3
"Overall I quite like this keyboard. Key feel is firm and responsive, well separated, and slightly concave, making it easy to feel. No double letters or missed spaces common to many wireless keyboards. Ergonomics are not bad and tilt legs help customise to preference.Minor qualms are that the ergonomic curve is pretty flat, so it's not particularly ergonomic. The legs on the front are too short - I'd prefer to have it tilted more aggressively backwards like my MS Ergonomic keyboard. I also dislike the up/down arrow keys being minimised and centered. The upper arrow **needs** to be above the side arrows, even if slightly. I use arrow keys a lot for moving around spreadsheets and documents and this makes it unnecessarily challenging. It makes far more sense to make the left/right arrows smaller instead.I can live with these as this is a secondary keyboard that floats around the house when I mix up my work space. However, two critical dedicated keys are missing from this keyboard - the home and end keys, which I use constantly. Yes, you can use them as alternative keys on the num pad, but I'm often also entering numbers, so it's frustrating to keep switching it on and off. I notice the absence of these frequently every time I use this board.These keys could be in place of the source switching keys above the numpad, and those could've been shrunk and located in the empty space in the middle of the keyboard under the indicator lights. With this layout it would be a 5 star product. As it stands, it's more of a 3.5.",3
"I'm going to write this review without correcting any istakes made by the keyboard. I assure you, i am doing my best to type as accrately as possible,,, wih no spelling errors. Straight out of the box, the keyboard does look nice. I bought it because it looked like it was a well-made product, and i wanted to treat myself. It is very light, and I can se it on my lap without discomfort. However, the u key is bent and sometimes rfuses to type. I also notice that when I am yping at a faster pace, some letters do reepeeat. While it is trivial to correct these mistakes, it is not helpful in a live text chat situation to continuously backtrack in order to correct istakes when others are already moving on from the previous topic. The bluetooth pairng also has to be reset almost every tme I pair the device bck up (reset, n this case, meaning to forget the device from the syste's bluetooth menu), which is rather interruptive if I want to type something right t that moment. It also disconnects after some inactivity, which I did not see specified in the uuser manual as a power saving feature - it only says it is supposed to trn off when the devie is closed. I will continue to use they keyboarrrd for a week, and if these problems do not improve with time, I will retrn it. I made an attempt to contact theee seller to see if these problems could be resolved, bt I did noot find the option nywhere, strangely enough.Anyway. The keyboard looks nice and does afford some usablitity I did not ave beforee, such as the arrow keys allowing for quicker corrections to text. The keyboard itself is not excessivey noisy, nor is ittt uncomfortably small. It IS small, but not in a way that impedes my typing. Hopefully the crret problems resolve theselves, because I do like the keyboarrd. I hope the nintentional typos speak for themselves as to the qualiity. I've nly had the keyboard - inside - for a little less than a day by the tme of writinng this review.",3
"I love the form factor and great price. Solid keyboard - 5 stars for functionality... Ok maybe 4+. However...at first the keyboard wouldn't even turn on. I thought it was the batteries and after two sets I kept monkeying with the connections of the battery holder....and it finally turned on. Fine - no problem. Stuff like that happens. That's when realized the on-off light glows red...not green? Hmm - So - I read the ultra-brief 4-page 3 x 5 directions and it doesn't describe the three LED lights on the upper right of the keyboard. I have no idea what two of them do or what they should indicate. The instructions indicate that one of the lights will blink on and off if the battery is low. Mine was steady red. and is labeled ""1"". Not on or off but ""1"". What does ""1"" mean? Who knows. There are some instructions for the alt function keys - and the keyboard seems to work fine. For me - it has a great feel. It's just annoying that the engineers did a fine job - but the marketing guys couldn't put together better instructions. Even weirder - who ever thought we'd ever need instructions for a simple keyboard??? Also - there is an addition to the numerical pad on the key board ""00"". It's where the ""0"" normally is....so - you'll have to get used to that if you are used to using a keypad.",3
"Overall, this NULEA keyboard has a nice feel to it, but it does have some issues. Quiet, but responsive feedback typing. Squishy hand rest.My main (maybe deal breaker?) complaint...The ENTER key is abnormally small & the DELETE key is abnormally long & close to the enter key! Who designed this & decided to change standard design?The round ""FN Lock"" key in the middle of the keyboard is an important button. You need to have that on if you want to use the volume or brightness buttons on a Mac. At first didn't think any of those features were working.I bought this ergonomic keyboard for home use to get the feel of ergonomic typing while waiting for the one at work to arrive. I am now using a fabulous Logitech ergo keyboard & mouse at work. The Logitech is FANTASTIC (& pricey), but it is so easy to get used to. The NULEA keyboard I'm reviewing/using is not as user friendly. I find myself hitting the wrong keys due to the enter key being smaller than any other keyboard I've ever used. The delete key is so long, right near the Enter key. So many mistakes & frustrations.",3
"EDIT: After using this for a couple of weeks I removed a star because some of the keys (particularly the ""N"") are prone to not getting typed, especially when I'm using the keyboard on my lap. Also, the numeric keypad is a great idea and works in a pinch, but I almost never get all the numbers I try to type in. The keys on the lower half of the keypad have a faint, but satisfying ""click"" when you press them, but the upper two tiers have no feedack at all. And it's all too common to press numbers that don't actually get input. This gets particularly frustrating because, since there is no physical way to distinguish the keys, you have to look at the keypad to use it, meaning you will not know until you look back at the screen whether the numbers have been entered correctly, and usually they will not have been.One thing I think is missing from most videos and photos is something representing the remake size of the keyboard, so I added a couple with my medium sized hand as reference.This device is wonderful out of the box, is easy to set up with multiple devices, and the TouchPad/NumPad works extremely well.I removed one star because it doesn't snap open, so it is unstable if you rest it on your lap - tends to fold back up in on itself. But for most common uses, this is a perfect keyboard/trackpad.",3
"Usually a good brand, but this one has a problem with num locks. Still usable, right size for my travel case.",3
"This is pretty, but the water runs out very quickly and I have to refill it almost daily to keep it going without it making loud noises. I've kept it for a year and continued to refill it, but now I am going to get a new one and will not purchase this one.",3
It looked wonderful at first. but now the light is out and there is not a simple way to replace it. S,3
Water often leaks over even when I put only a small amount.,3
"The media could not be loaded. I picked this fountain because I liked the window waterfall I thought it was cool looking and reminds me of a yoga pose, but the sound was so loud it sounded like a running sink. I found an easy fix as the sound is coming from the screen so you just have to pull it up so the water can fall though. I like it much better now!",3
Water sounds are good,3
"I'm a little disappointed with this fountain. It comes with two water flows that you can change with the switch on the pump. Keep it on the low setting because the high setting will splash water outside of the bowl. I tried it on high, adjusting water levels and position of the elephants, but it always ended up with splashing water. I filled the water to the recommended level and even placed a thin sponge in the base. This reduced the vibration sound but I continue to hear the pump rather than the sound of trickling water. The fountain does look cute. I added some rocks in the bowl to give it a nicer appearance and some weight. My clients seem to enjoy the appearance of it but I just wish that I could hear the water rather than the pump. Kind of bummed out. The seller did send the fountain in great condition and in good time. They were very quick to answer my questions and generously offered to resolve the issue.",3
"First take was it was definitely small. But ok, still liked the design. Well, hmm, no instructions as to how the pump suctions inside the base - doesn't line up. And to stop the pump from buzzing louder than the fountain had to put stones around the pump to keep it from free floating inside the fountain (thus causing the buzz). Then, since it's so small, the water splashes out of the unit - enough that I have to place something all around the fountain to absorb the splash. Would return but as I said, like the design. Not worth the effort.",3
"Beautiful, but look little bit ""cheap""",3
"When I first got this fountain, I found it absolutely beautiful and relaxing. But after a while, I started to notice that there were water stains around the table and floor in the area it sits. I keep cleaning it, but it is splashing a lot, so I turn it off when I am not in the room and have put a mat under the floor area where it sits.Overall it is a beautiful fountain. The sounds are relaxing and the light is gorgeous, but it splashes and if you have hard water, it will certainly make a mess and need to be cleaned often.",3
"It's so Pretty! The balance of water you need and the flow of the fountain is awful. This will be a High Maintenance fountain. I bought 2, so high maintenance fountains! :( For the price, it's so flimsy. Save your money. Spend more money and get a better quality fountain!",3
I like the soothing sounds and pretty design buy I wish it was a bit bigger. It's easy to put together. I like the light feature too.,3
I like the soothing sounds and pretty design buy I wish it was a bit bigger. It's easy to put together. I like the light feature too.,3
"Tiny, itty bitty fountain. Disappointed by how big it looked in the pictures. The hands must be photo shopped. Paint isn’t metallic and really is just brown, not copper/gold like pictured. I will say that it hums, so if you’re wanting water noises this isn’t a great one for that. The marble spins and is fun to watch, the lights work great and it’s a nice display. Have to fiddler with the water pressure though. It has a dial to change the pumps strength. It had no instructions so you had to just kind of play with it to put it together just right",3
"I had to have help with the assembling, but it works fine. The water is a bit noisier than what I had in the past, but it sits far enough away that it is tolerable. For the money, it's a good buy.",3
Unfortunately water pump stopped working after 1 week due to use of tap water instead of Distilled Water.If product description had implicitly advised the use of Distilled Water; the thoughts of purchasing it might have been reconsidered.,3
"At first I thought this was the easiest, low maintenance fountain I have gotten since normally the rest are quite an ordeal to acomodare and clean. This one is quite simple in that aspect. HOWEVER, set up was not easy and you’ll have to tinker with it ALOT every time you need to clean or move anyting around to get the motor to silence. It will not be enough to just fully cover with water.The tube that came is super hard and long so you will have a terrible time cutting it until it’s exactly perfect. Don’t do it all at once because if you cut it too short it’s done. The tube is way too small for the connector so you will do quite a bit of struggling and I can definitely see how most people never get it in. Once I did I couldn’t get it out. So now it’s too long and since it’s so hard and won’t sit upright suction-cupped to the bottom as it’s meant to but instead sideways.Even when completely submerged the motor makes sound that’s louder than the splashing water so you need to continuously tinker with it and move it around until you get it to stop making noise. Unfortunately with other systems I’ve had when this happens eventually there will come a time the noise won’t stop.I love the design and simplicity of this style. My concern is how long with it function accordingly.We shall see!",3
"Be aware of the size.Although I did read the dimensions, I was still surprised when I saw it. Very small!I kept it, because I did like the style. Just put it in a different place.",3
"I got this to replace the ""River Bend"" fountain I had in my office, which doesn't seem to be available any more. The River Bend had 3 broad lips for the water to fall over, so it produced a very pretty, soft waterfall/rainfall noise if you scattered pebbles across the lips.This bowl fountain has 3 narrow spillways. The first two are so close to the bowls that they produce no sound at all. The third sounds like a faucet running or, like one client said ""an old guy taking a leak"". I've put some strategic blockages in the spillways and managed to get a fairly decent sound -- one I can live with, anyway -- but nothing as pretty as the Riverbend.The fountain is quite sturdily built and easy to assemble, and I've had no problems with splashing or spillover.",3
"I bought this for my little greenhouse cabinet. It’s good for the price but certainly constructed cheaply (obviously). When I first pulled it out of the box and filled it with water, it was spurting water out of the bottom and not the top. So I took it apart, gently pulling the tower from the base and unscrewing the top cover. It was broken in one corner and the pump wasn’t connected to the tube leading up the tower. I snapped those together and found whatever the little light was attached to was snapped off broken as well. So, while all the parts and pieces work, it didn’t arrive ready to go and required some tinkering. If you buy this and it doesn’t work correctly, try taking it apart and checking the pump connection. I’m happy with this purchase overall. I’m including a photo of the type of pump used in this fountain. Once I connected everything and got it assembled, it worked great. Use distilled water in this only to avoid the mineralization.",3
Product was fine at first but the light stopped working 3 days ago and it was delivered on Oct. 14th. I thought I had 30 day's to return this which I was going to on the 6th. I am very disappointed that I am out $31.,3
"This is a pretty product, but way too loud for my office as a therapist. The sound is quiet sometimes but unpredictable. Also when it is quiet the water makes virtually no noise which I dislike. I love the sound of trickling water. This fountain overall is not worth it",3
"The product was okay but could have been better. The packaging came broke which was a little disappointing. It really did not meet my expectations.Noise level is medium, fountain size is accurate to the description and the functionality is great. Giving 3 starts coz of the damage.",3
I found it very small but working properly so far so I guess I’ll use it for now,3
The flower looked great on table top but difficult to assemble and the petals and flowers kept falling apart.,3
The listing says it makes soothing noise. But the water drop each level is half an inch so it's soundless. Otherwise the light and pump work well.We returned it as we wanted the trickle sound.,3
"Please, no matter how tiny the fish are, do not put fish in here. They will die. One minute they will disappear into the abyss (the back area) and some will die from the rapids.",3
"It's cute and I like that it has the candle holders, but even on its highest setting, you can barely hear the water flow. Motor is quiet, but I expected a little more noise from the running water.",3
"I received the item today. Per the instruction manual, I put the item together.The issue I have with the product is there is no control switch (on and off). You have to physically plug and unplug the device, which I find antiquated because most products have a control switch.In addition, the machine is not quiet but loud.",3
"this item has a light in the top bowl, which doesn’t make a lot of sense. You can’t see it unless you’re looking right into the bowl from the top. It would’ve made better sense to put a light in each one of the bowls.",3
"I purchased in Sept 2022 and it stop working today in Jul 2023. It was fine while it lasted. It recommends to use filtered water and gunk can build up. I cleaned it out maybe 2x a month, which helped it. This morning it simply stopped working; no lights, no hum from the pump, nothing. I won't replace it for the price, but take care of yours and hopefully it lasts longer than mine did.",3
Absolutely no directions in the box. Once inside the device pump kept falling apart. The hole in the back is not big enough to fit both fingers and pump in at the same time. Would NOT reccomend.,3
"This waterfall is great. Quiet pump and very attractive design. HOWEVER, it burns through water pretty quickly. I refill every 2-3 days. I have it on a timer for about 4 hours a day. The frequent water refilling is the only caveat. Other than that, I’d buy again.",3
"I bought this fountain in November and have used it daily. I used only Reverse Osmosis water in it, and cleaned it regularly to remove the sort of “slimy” buildup that occurred in the base. It is now August, 9 months after purchase, and it is splashing so much water out both left and right sides that it has become unusable which is disappointing because I was enjoying it!Pros:* Easy assembly* Nice appearance* Didn’t require daily refilling (only about every third day)* Pump was quiet* Fairly loud water sounds. You could hear the water sounds in other rooms. This could be a pro or a con depending on what you’re wanting.Cons:* No adjustment on pump. Maybe my pump arrived broken, but there is no way to adjust the strength of the flow, so it was only high. This meant…* Splashing. No matter how I tried positioning rocks, or removing them altogether, this fountain left splashes around it, particularly on the left side. **This got significantly worse over time.*** Loud water sounds. I wanted more of a “trickling” sound for relaxation purposes, and this was definitely stronger than that, again because the pump lacked any way to adjust the flow strength. This didn’t stop me from enjoying the fountain while it was functioning properly, it just wasn’t my preference.If this fountain hadn’t become so splash-y, I would have rated it higher. As it is, though, only giving 9 months of use, I don’t believe it gave good value for the money I spent.",3
"Product was nice while it lasted, had this set up in my bathroom and it ran most of the day. ALWAYS made sure it was full with water, product last about a month and the pump went out. Don’t recommend buying unless you plan on having it on very rarely. You will be buying another or buying another pump.",3
"The fountain looks really nice. The main issue was the instructions. Very vaugue and wasn't clear on the tilting was needed not that it might tilt so I made a mess. The cord will not go into the place where there is an opening for it. So yes it is pretty, but sounds more like a leaky faucet instead of a nice flow. Not sure I want to keep this.",3
Pump has suction cups but need to put pump in at an angle to avoid slurping sounds and need to add water many times a day otherwise slurping begins again. Overpriced.,3
There should be water sound too. Which is missing,3
"This is a cute little fountain- it gives the relaxing, trickle water sound one may be looking for. However, the emptying leaf only works when fountain is on a high setting and thus, water splashes everywhere. As a matter of fact, no matter what setting it's on, water is splashing everywhere. It's very messy. I do love that it is easy to clean. The lights aren't bright enough to use as any type of true light- gentle lighting as part of the ambiance. Think christmas lights.",3
"Purchased this fountain last year in July. Loved it, but the light quit late summer and now I plugged in for spring and the fountain does not work at all. Very frustrating! Thought this fountain would last longer . Probably would not buy again. I have other fountains that I have had for years and they still work. Guess I will have to use this one as a centerpiece!",3
"The media could not be loaded. PROS: Beautiful water area, overall design.CONS: Loud overall, needs extra assembly.In short: if better constructed, I would’ve kept this potted tree fountain.Hot-glue work was sloppy and needed to be redone, the pump tubing was too long, and although the water sounds were good unfortunately with the sounds of the pump it was overall too loud for my taste.",3
It was smaller than I expected but it’s nice and relaxing!,3
"Such a cute little water feature for the price but you can hear the water trickle (which is kind of the point). Luckily you can't hear the motor either. The glass ball that came with won't roll. It's too heavy. It was the biggest pain to put together we had to cut a piece of the tubing to fit. The rocks are cute. If you think the little water holders are wood covered. Nope. They are just plastic made to look like wood. It's not horrible, but I wouldn't gift it to anyone unless you warn them it's not high quality.",3
"Good product but misses on the water flow sound, silent water doesn’t make sense",3
When I first got the fountain it was smaller and not as loud (water fall noise) as I wanted it to be but it worked well for what it’s worth. However a month into the product it started leaking and that’s where the product gets the rating from. It’s unfortunate that it started leaking a week after the return window closed.,3
The media could not be loaded. It has an unpleasant sound and not comfortable to hear.,3
The dish is nice works well so far. My complaint is due to the cheaply made parts and construction. The stand is awful and not sturdy at all. Any pressure and the weak legs unscrew and falls to the ground. The plastic parts are also frail looking and weak. Getting the rubber grommet in the bowl to plug properly was also very difficult to secure. I'm keeping it...I think...but wouldn't order again due to being so poorly made.,3
needs to clean often,3
"The media could not be loaded. I love the style of this little water feature. As you can see in the video, I have placed it in a larger vessel and placed rocks around it for a larger look. The light comes on, and I’m very happy with that but the ball does not flow around like it says it’s supposed to. Disappointing.",3
"i have had many fountains. this is nice, quiet water fountain but needs a lot of effort to assemble.when you read the title, you probably think i'm a dumb axx. if you have this fountain in front of you, and you would know what i said is true.first of all, the main tube is slightly short, so the pump would be easily disconnected if it was pushed down or when you tried to wiggly insert into the fountain. you have to leave pump unsecured and hope when you put in, either tube or pump connector wouldn't disconnect.Secondly, it has connected tube for 2nd water flow which is too long, so tube is bent when everything connected together, the 2nd water flow would have very little flows. in the mean time, you have to be careful not to disconnect the pump (my 1st point).other than those, it works well.",3
"I didn't buy this for the beauty, it's okay to look at, nothing spectacular, I bought this for the relaxing sound. But it's barely a trickle. I kept it because I wanted to spruce up my at home office space, but it's just okay. I wish I could find a good fountain that actually had a louder, fountain sound! Any recommendations, I'd gladly take them.",3
I only use it when I have guests over as it dries up too fast. Watch the water or it will die.,3
"This fountain makes barely any sound, unless you take the marble out. (The light is bright form inside of it)First thing that happened is the little plastic bowl the marble sits in. became unattached while trying to connect the pump to the hose. Had to super glue that back in. Also only comes with enough rocks to cover right in front of statue. They also needed to be washed before put into the fountain. So much dust and dirt.Will I buy it again when it dies? No.But it’s cute and perfect for now.",3
"Good quality, looks good. I’m disappointed it makes zero noise. Not even a single trickle of water sound . That was whole reason I bought it",3
Absolutely love this fountain except the motor died after the 1st use. If it wasn't for that I would give 5 starts but I had to purchase a second motor and that ended up increasing the over all price of the fountain. Not very happy about it :/It doesn't make much water sound because of how smooth the ceramic is I believe. I places couple of rocks on each level and it resolved that issue. Over all I love it but I wish the motor was better quality.,3
Really pretty desktop fountain but the pump stopped working within 3 months. It also seems to run out of water significantly faster than other fountains.,3
"Nice, perfect for my decor,",3
"Smaller than I expected but I’m bad with measurements. Probably not worth the price but it’s cute enough and it’s really for my boyfriend’s cat. She hasn’t seen it yet. If I’d know the cord couldn’t be hidden or tucked into a notch for it, I might not have purchased. Stars are based on value for the money.",3
The picture shows a pleasant green light in the fountain and this is just not the case. It is white only. I really hate false advertisement.,3
"I bought a used fountain, and when it arrived it didn’t work. My husband, being a handyman, took it apart and found the issue. A small plastic ring had broken off part of the section that spins to push the water up the fountain. After some superglue and a little sanding, we got it work properly.Even if I had purchased a brand new one, the fountain is very cheaply made and likely won’t last long. Is it worth $70 for a one time use in your wedding cake or at an event? If your budget allows, sure. Please don’t purchase expecting a lifetime of use from it. Advice for others: order it early to give adequate time for a return and a new fountain just in case it doesn’t work.",3
"Didn’t feel it was worth it, also wish it was a bit louder. The finishing looks and feels cheap. Ease of assembly was helpful. Would not purchase again.",3
"If you are looking for a water feature to fall asleep to at night, this is not the one for you, however, if you are looking for one for your desk at work to help, call me, then I would suggest purchasing this. Minimal maintenance, easy to assemble and works well. I purchased it for my basement bedroom to possibly help me fall asleep at night with the water sounds but it’s not quite loud enough. I moved it to my desk at work and it’s perfect.",3
It's cute but way smaller than what I expected,3
Has a hole in the bottom so glue before you even try to fill it. It’s almost like it’s intentionally put there. Other than that it’s been fine and great little office fountain on my desk,3
... stop working... I clean it once a week to mantain properly but just stop working😒,3
"I love how easy this was to set up. It looks great, even if it is a little smaller than I thought it would beOften overflows and leaks Have not yet figured out why",3
"This fountain is definitely pretty to look at but assembling the pump is a pain in the rear. It took a while but I finally got it working, I had almost given up though. You have to fill it pretty often if you plan to leave it running all the time. Also the way you turn it on is to just plug it in, there's no on/off switch. If the outlet you're using isn't easily accessible it turns into you not wanting to turn it on at all, especially if you have to move furniture or stoop to plug/unplug it. A simple switch on the cord would be a HUGE improvement.",3
It's a really charming little fountain and it makes a wonderful flowing water sound. My only problem with it was the sound that the pump makes. It's almost as loud as the water itself and very distracting when you're trying to relax to the sound of the water.,3
"I was disappointed and embarrassed when I purchased this fountain for my parent for Christmas and it turned out to be a cheap, lightweight resin instead of ceramic. I thought for the price and the size of the item, that it would have been the real deal. There are other ceramic ones that I have purchased from Amazon for a comparable price, but I chose this one for the color. If you want a ceramic one, make sure that's what you're paying for. Also, although it has pretty lights, it makes no trickling noise whatsoever, so it's not that soothin--borderline pointless.",3
Nice little water feature if used without the fog atomizer. The atomizer is a very cool feature but I can't keep it from spitting mist/water no matter how much I adjust the water level. Solution anyone? As I write this review I'd probably have not purchased due to the price. And because of the spitting water and secondly very disappointed in the plastic plants; they are pretty cheap looking. But if you can get past the negatives it is just okay.,3
"The media could not be loaded. I gave this product 3 stars because it does work as the description states. However, I regret the purchase and do not recommend unless you live in a place that is always sunny.- The fountain will not work unless it is in FULL sun, hence, it will not work in the shade of a tree or an overcast day. I added a video to show what it does on a cloudy day, it gurgles. The fountain doesn’t charge like some of my other solar items. I wanted to put it right under a tree branch for the birds because they prefer to come down for a drink and fly back to a tree for safety. I’m unable to use the fountain as I wanted.- If the sun comes and goes, the fountain does too. The water will spurt out the top.- I did appreciate the little plastic straws that help keep the fountain in the center.- The water has to be at least 2 inches deep to allow the fountain to work. If working as stated, the fountain will shoot too high and it ends up splashing water out of the birdbath. Maybe it would work better with something deeper than what I’m using. I’m constantly having to fill up the bath.- My birdbath was a happening place until I put the fountain in. Enough said.",3
"This fountain is powerful (like the Texas Sun where I am)! I didn’t have any cloudy days when I tested it, sorry. I’ve no complaints on the powerful spray itself. Creates a nice pattern, and there’s plenty to choose from. Easy to assemble and choosing a spray is easy and fun, using the glossary and testing it out.* note* the fountain works instantly! That’s great, but it also doesn’t store energy, so no spray at night (or I assume on dark days). For all the above I give it 5 stars. However, here’s the problem I couldn’t overcome:This is a free floating device. The spray moves it around the birdbath, and it inherently stays next to the side, causing half the spray to land outside the birdbath until it drained all the water! I tried fixing the gizzy to various items, but never was successful. Maybe something could be epoxied onto the birdbath for gizzy to be adhered to. For you crafty types and for this cheap price, maybe you can figure it out. I gave up and put my St. Anthony statue in the birdbath instead.",3
"I wanted to love this so much! The directions were easy to follow, set-up was a breeze, and it made a beautiful fountain. My plan was to plant flowers along the perimeter of a large pot, then put a smaller pot in the middle for the fountain. Unfortunately, the pot I used is too small in diameter (8”), so all the water splashes out of the pot and it runs out of water too quickly. It even splashes over the side of the larger pot on the bottom, which is 14” in diameter. I went through 1.5 gallons of water in about 1/2 hour. I’m bummed this is so impractical because it looked so good. I’m going to see if I can find something wide enough to contain the water so it can be reused instead of splashing out.",3
Only works in bright direct sun. It also fell apart after a short time.,3
"The media could not be loaded. Update: I have added another star to my review for customer service. Seller reached out to me giving me several different suggestions to improve quality of situation at hand. I believe the product itself isn't the issue possibly just wind in the environment that pushes fountain to the side. Seller offered full refund, when I declined offer due to device not being defective, seller still refunded money due to not being 100% satisfied with product.Purchased this with excitement for my bird bath and quickly realized it's not quite functional. The product does work, has many different spout options for different flow opoptions. I like the solar power, very easy to set up and use. As you can see with the pics/videos I have had to find things to secure the fountain in the middle of the bird bath so it doesn't spray all the water out.",3
"Got this to put in a stock tank with goldfish. It stays afloat, and it isn’t bothered by the sludge (so far after three months of use). But it floats in and out of the sunlight, only working in the direct sunlight. Not surprising, as it is solar powered. Wish it was a little more stationary to stay in the sun. But it is cute, and it does its intended job. I would buy it again.",3
The fountain was easy to setup and activate. But then the fun started. I filled the bird bath with water until it almost overflowed and I set the fountain on the lowest setting inside which auto entered with the plastic arms. After 45 minutes the bird bath was empty. So I placed the fountain in a water trough that holds 10 gallons of water. 2 hours later the trough was half empty. I filled it to the top and again hours later the water was low. I’m surprised that much water evaporated so quickly. The fountain is now in the garage not being used. Nothing wrong with this product it just requires way too much effort to keep functional,3
"This product works as far as flow and pump. But was disappointed because it does not power on if you do not have it in direct sunlight. I was hoping it would charge during the day which I AZ is very bright and the be able to run on a charge when the sun goes down. Well, that didn't happen, if you do not have it in direct sunlight it doesn't work. My porch is extremely bright and sunny but it will not work. Very disappointed that I can't place it on my porch. Plus it gets really hot in AZ and the directions say not to use in hot temperatures, well we get over 110 degrees and the fountain doesn't work if not in direct sunlight. Very 😢",3
"The product initially came defective so I requested a replacement. The replacement came 6 days later and worked beautifully. The instructions were poor, but it was easy to figure out. The problem I had was not the fault of the product. Each sprayer worked beautifully and looked great, but 3,5w was simply too much for my 17” wide, 3” deep bath. Set on the lowest spray setting and using the head that did not go high was even too much. 5 mph wind on a sunny day blew the water out of the bath leaving nothing in the bowl within 2 hours. The only one that worked without spitting the water out of the bowl was the bubbler. Additionally, the first and replacement set did not come with the pieces described and pictured, although I did like the ones it came with, you may not. It did not have the high center tube. The birds were attracted to all the spray settings. The instructions lacked a description of how and when to clean the filter, which is an important piece of information. I’ll keep this one, but will order a different brand in the future.",3
Worked beautifully in the beginning now it doesn’t work at all.,3

bought this thinking i could have a fountain in my bird bath but it doesn’t work well. For starters you have to have a bird bath that holds a good amount of water at a depth or it will not completely submerge. secondly you have to have full sun if it’s overcast in any way you get a constant splash instead of a solid flow,3
Clever design and well made. Multiple nozzles are easy to install. Works great-in bright sunlight. HOWEVER-The slightest bit of shade or a cloud in the sky is enough to shut it down. Needs direct sunlight to work. I know it’s solar powered but these are the weakest solar cells I have ever run into. Should at least work on a bright cloudless day without needing direct sunlight beating down on it.,3
"I thought I received a dud also, until I realised that the pump when working was blowing air so I connected the hole of the pump to the underside of the solar disc, the suction cups seem to be for attaching to the bottom of a shallow surface to keep from floating around. The instructions are not clear at all.Tested mine in a bucket which I could move around in the sun as it is now winter and my bird bath is in the full shade.Let's see how long it works for, will be putting away until warmer weather and more sun.",3
"Really great addition to a kids water table! There is one problem I had with it, however. There are four little plastic “straws” that attach to the sides to help pull in water for the fountain. My standard water table does not allow for all four to fit, so I had to cut them, and now the fountain does not work quite as intended. Still a fun toy, but definitely be aware that if you are purchasing for your child’s water table, measure beforehand! Also…don’t leave it out in the sun in an empty water table. Or else you might go crazy, as I did, trying to find the wounded-sounding animal in your yard…. (The solar panel aspect makes it continue to try to pump water even when not in said water!)",3
"The fountain has lots of different attachments and is easy to assemble. The biggest downside is that it MUST stay in full sun to work. It depends on your location. I only get a couple of hours of use do to the sun location and shading, it must not have any internal battery because it doesn’t store the solar energy.",3
"Used this for the water dish on our deck for the birds, but it is only working when there is absolute direct sunlight. Any shade and it does not work. This is similar to one we previously purchased but the other one would work when there were clouds. Definitely would not buy again.",3
If this is in a more shallow bird bath it just sprays all the water out. If it’s in something more deep then the sun can’t get down enough to power it. Three stars because it pumps water through decently enough so I’m sure it could work in some scenario. But did not really work for my circumstances,3
did not like this product. doesnt work as said on descrition,3
Works great but…in an hour it had pumped all the water out of birdbath - had to place rocks on bumpers to hold in center. Still it emptied water!! I need a way to restrict pump so it’s not so powerful!! Right now Inhave a slim rock leaning over hole to make itMore like a bubbler - anyone have an idea? It’s frustrating,3
Couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work until I found the suction cups out the pump were put on upside down,3
"This product worked possibly one month. Then, one day...just stopped working!!! Don't waste your money.",3
"This product works as far as flow and pump. But was disappointed because it does not power on if you do not have it in direct sunlight. I was hoping it would charge during the day which I AZ is very bright and the be able to run on a charge when the sun goes down. Well, that didn't happen, if you do not have it in direct sunlight it doesn't work. My porch is extremely bright and sunny but it will not work. Very disappointed that I can't place it on my porch. Plus it gets really hot in AZ and the directions say not to use in hot temperatures, well we get over 110 degrees and the fountain doesn't work if not in direct sunlight. Very 😢",3
"The product initially came defective so I requested a replacement. The replacement came 6 days later and worked beautifully. The instructions were poor, but it was easy to figure out. The problem I had was not the fault of the product. Each sprayer worked beautifully and looked great, but 3,5w was simply too much for my 17” wide, 3” deep bath. Set on the lowest spray setting and using the head that did not go high was even too much. 5 mph wind on a sunny day blew the water out of the bath leaving nothing in the bowl within 2 hours. The only one that worked without spitting the water out of the bowl was the bubbler. Additionally, the first and replacement set did not come with the pieces described and pictured, although I did like the ones it came with, you may not. It did not have the high center tube. The birds were attracted to all the spray settings. The instructions lacked a description of how and when to clean the filter, which is an important piece of information. I’ll keep this one, but will order a different brand in the future.",3
Worked beautifully in the beginning now it doesn’t work at all.,3
bought this thinking i could have a fountain in my bird bath but it doesn’t work well. For starters you have to have a bird bath that holds a good amount of water at a depth or it will not completely submerge. secondly you have to have full sun if it’s overcast in any way you get a constant splash instead of a solid flow,3
Clever design and well made. Multiple nozzles are easy to install. Works great-in bright sunlight. HOWEVER-The slightest bit of shade or a cloud in the sky is enough to shut it down. Needs direct sunlight to work. I know it’s solar powered but these are the weakest solar cells I have ever run into. Should at least work on a bright cloudless day without needing direct sunlight beating down on it.,3

"I bought this to replace the pump on my bird bath in the front yard. One issue I knew going in - there's no battery as part of the system so any shading turns the pump off right away. My old one had a small battery that would keep the pump going for quite a long time after the sun was off it, or through temporary clouds.The other issue is that the shut off isn't very effective. It will eventually shut off, but many a time I've gone outside to hear the pump grinding away with no water and the pump is still just moist. Living in the South West where it is > 100F all summer my small bird bath can dry out daily so I assumed this wold cause the pump to burn out very quickly but so far it has kept going through the summer. YMMV.My previous pump was either more sensitive to the water level or the sensor was better placed, I don't know. I guess the solution for me is to bury a big reservoir of water below the bird path so it runs of out water less frequently.",3
"I bought a different one a while back but it didn't light up or hold a charge. It only works when the sun is on it. If a cloud moves over, it would turn off. So I saw this one, and I loved that it had lights. I felt the $30 price tag was too high but I really wanted to try it out. I sit out with the dogs a lot at night and I have tons of solar things all over the yard. This fountain was a waste of money. It does light up, but barely (doesn't matter that we've had nothing but straight sun with no clouds in 2 months), you can't see it unless you get right up on it and only then because you're looking down at the little bulbs. The suction is weak so it barely puts out a spray (no matter the nozzle used) and the charge only lasts about an hour after sundown. My original cheap one is much better, I get a nice size spray from the fountain. Ah well, it's like everything else ... all those bells and whistles (the lights and longer solar charge) are just a way to raise the price for less product.",3
"The media could not be loaded. This little solar powered fountain works great for the money. If you’re looking for a simple and cheap fountain the different nozzles included and the pressure of the fountain will scratch that itch.-Here’s what you need to know - the pressure is dependent on how much sun the solar panel gets.-Shady? Don’t plan on your fountain working.Sunny? Your fountain will be the star of the garden.-It would be nice if there was a stored battery and an on / off switch to control when the pump ran or for when the clouds came by so the pump would continue to run.-As you will see in the video the pump is working nice, but if I step in front of the solar panel the pump stops working.If your fountain runs out of water the pump will continue to run. A shut off float would be nice, but is probably an added cost to produce.-For the money this is a good value pump. Overall I would recommend and buy again.",3
"No installation needed works right out of the box. But, it does not work in my bird baths as they are not deep enough. I’ve tried other deep bowls but the fountain sprays out of the fountain needing to replace the water frequently. It works fine, spray is great, it just needs a very deep, large bowl so you do not need to refill water all day. Love the fountain, just have not found a bowl deep enough to work with it .",3
"It works really well, easy to set up and is a nice addition to our bird bath. My only issue is that it doesn't last as long as I would like in the Arizona sun but that's to be expected. It's budget friendly enough that I bought another when my first stopped working. Really like this fountain and highly recommend it. If you live in a very hot and dry climate, keep that in mind.",3
"I have turned my backyard into a bird oasis complete with several bird (and squirrel) feeders. The only thing that is missing is a bird bath. I decided to purchase a bird bath because the birds like to get into the water dish on one of the bird feeders so it is always dirty and full of seeds, etc. I saw this solar powered fountain and thought that it would be a nice touch to add to the bird bath. It is solar powered so i don't have to worry about charging it or replacing batteries in it. It is very easy to set up and use and it makes a wonderful addition to my backyard bird oasis.",3
"It's a really nice little fountain. It only functions when in direct sunlight, there's no battery to store charge for night or cloudy days. Having multiple nozzles for different water effects is great. The trouble is, unless your water receptacle is really wide, most of them just spray water or and you have to keep refilling it. But if your receptacle is big enough to catch all the water, the fountain won't stay centered because the brackets aren't long enough. Luckily two of the nozzles don't overstay, and those look really nice.",3
"I have a multi-tier bird bath/fountain that I used this for. It worked great, exactly as stated it would. Turned off if the water got too low. The solar panel actually worked well even on some cloudy days. I was very pleased. Then it stopped working very well. Then it stopped all together. It hasn’t even been a year. But for the price? It was worth it.",3
"Died on me after about a month. Cleaned it, just stopped working . Had to order a different solar fountain",3
"The fountain has lots of different attachments and is easy to assemble. The biggest downside is that it MUST stay in full sun to work. It depends on your location. I only get a couple of hours of use do to the sun location and shading, it must not have any internal battery because it doesn’t store the solar energy.",3
"Edit: I’m changing my review from 1 to 3. The little motor *does* work, but the water temperature can’t be too hot.Unfortunately for our little fountain, we live in the south and our summers are brutal. Yesterday morning it was working great, but as the day went on and the water heated up in the sun, its power dwindled. It needs full sun (no clouds whatsoever) to run consistently, but the temperatures also have to be just right.Basically, you get what you pay for with this little guy. It’s inexpensive, but with that price point comes definite quality limitations. I wouldn’t recommend this to someone who lives in an especially hot climate, but if you live in a more mild area, I think it would be just fine.———The little motor works great outside of water, but it almost completely stops as soon as it’s submerged. Water spits out sometimes, but it’s not a steady or significant stream.",3
After a few month water barely comes out. I cleaned filter where items may get stuck and clog it and the tubing for water but still not much power. It use to work great. Fountain is in full sun for 6hrs and there is always water so I don't think it's over heated,3
"Bird bath fountain work ok when basin is full of water,... EXCEPT wind blows all he water out and then it stops working. Also, the 4 plastic tubes attached to fountain are supposed to stabilize it, but they come lose & end up floating in water, and sending the fountain askew. Now one of the plastic tubes has disappeared, so the fountain won't stay stable. I bought 2 other fountains and have used one, which is much better and cost about the same amount.",3
"This compact solar fountain is a good choice for areas of full, uninterrupted sunlight as it does not charge and continue to operate out of full sunshine to which I was disappointed with as my backyard patio is covered, but gets nice morning and evening sunlight in late spring through early fall. Thus this fountain barely performed in that location. I moved it out to the front deck which is full sun all day and it worked amazing. I spent several minutes changing out the different spray attachments to see how each worked and looked before selecting one. Changing the attachments is very easy so that is a plus. There are also four clips and plastic tubes which attach to the underside of the fountain to help it stay centered in whatever basin, birdbath, bowl or container it is placed, if you want, and the tubes can be cut to accommodate. Once I had it situated and my container filled with water, I was initially pleased with the power of the spray and the overall look. However, upon returning about 10 minutes later to check it, the fountain had STOPPED! It had used up all the water in the roughly 10inch diameter x 3inch deep basin! My conclusion was that most of the water spray had gone up and over the edges of the basin thanks to a light breeze and the attachment I had selected. Since I live in an area that is always a bit breezy, I'm going to need to reevaluate the size of the container to catch the falling water and/or a way to fully secure the fountain to the center of whatever container I use to avoid water spray over the sides.After all this, I'm not sure I will keep the product or if a submersible fountain set up will work better for what I want.",3
"Like many have said before, if you get even the slightest misty cloud in the sky the power of will be greatly reduced. But when it is full sun it shoots extremely high in the air which basically clears out your water bowl.So make sure to have a pretty wide water bowl or something to stop the water from shooting straight into the sky.I had to modify the holes on my piece to be a little bigger so that the water pressure wasn’t as hard. That helped with the distance",3
I wish I had read all reviews and all of the details of the item itself. It really does not work without the solar panel being in direct sunlight. I don't have one area in my yard that is full sun all day so no matter where I've moved this is doesn't work for more than a few hours at a time. Unfortunately just doesn't work for my yard. I guess I assumed that like most solar panel it would store solar energy for the shady time of day. Otherwise it works well for the size and cost.,3
"It has no gradient of operation, it is either running full speed or not at all. I guess I expected in moderately overcast conditions it would run slow, it doesn't. It needs full direct sunlight to run. When it runs, it runs great. But I live in Ohio, we get a lot of days where it is partly cloudy or slightly overcast. It does not perform well in these conditions.",3
"Very pretty , easy to use - suction cup broke off right away, but I tied it on with fishing line :) Fountain worked for 8 months perfectly... then died... no amount of cleaning (which it didn't need) brought it back to life :( Too Bad!",3
I have like 4 solar fountains I like them this one is for the most part good but sometimes the it doesn't work and the lights and ok but don't look like pictures,3
It's cute,3
It worked great for a few months and has stopped working. I bought three different size pumps and only one with a different brand solar panel is still working.,3
"It's a cute feature, but if the smallest bit of shade crosses in front of the solar panel (even the shadow of palm leaves swaying back and forth) the amount of power the pump has is greatly diminished.",3
"I like this solar fountain, I use it in a bird bath to add some ambiance sound in our backyard and it attracts the birds and even bees drink from it. This one floats around though and often goes to one side because of the wind (even with the clear stick things). They make them now with build it ""wings"" or ""legs"" so it stays in the center. This also helps the bees so they don't drown. There are several different attachments to create different effects.It sometimes doesn't work when the full sun is on it. It goes on and off like it's confused and it annoys me. I wish it worked consistently with the full sun.",3
It's cute. And small.Instructions in English instead of Italian would have been very helpful but I figured it out.,3
"The usual issues with made in China stuff, the instructions appear to be written in English but, the translator is not fully fluent in English. They at least added some trouble shooting ideas....I bought two of these, with the thought that some parts might not work that well and I was right.The implication in the instructions is that if the pump fails it is due to either a lack of sunshine or a clogged filter...no mention is made that the motor itself can simply stop working, which one of mine did.If you hold the apparatus in the sunshine and you do NOT hear the motor, assume it has failed and NO apparent way to fix it exists.",3
"I really loved it when it worked. Purchased mid June, now it’s early August and broken, super disappointing.",3
"average product, only works under direct strong sun",3
"Works great as long as it has direct sunlight exposure at all times.Spurts at sun rise and sunset, cloud obscuring, tree leave filtering ..... anything more than full direct sun is a detriment to function. If you desire fountain effects anytime, solar is not for you.If your fountain is in the middle of the desert, away from all obstructions, this is for you.Otherwise, best find a different toy :D",3
"I love the options with this fountain. It’s very soothing to watch and listen to. My birds have enjoyed it. Nice size and easy setup. However, like most solar products, it stops working after a while. I got my first one at Christmas and purchased another one to replace it. So, for me, they last about 4 months. I’ll eventually get another.",3
"the pump works, but was disappointed with the length of the power cord - it was not 9ft more like 3ft.",3
"This is a pretty cool fountain I bought for use in our bird bath. It worked to keep the water moving. It doesn't have a lower button, runs only on solar. If it's in a shaded area or cloudy it didn't work (to be expected as it's solar). It lasted about 3 months before it had become clogged and unable to run.",3
"I ordered this and it worked fabulously for two weeks. The panel is in full sun, water level was kept high and clean, cleaned filter when needed and interior parts. It just stopped working this morning, period. No troubleshoot helped. Asking for a replacement since it's within the return window, hoping the next one is fine because this is pricey for something that doesn't last. I have other smaller ones that have the circular panel built in and just float in the wAter that have been working for months, but bought this for my bigger fountain since I liked the ability of the panel to hold a charge where the others don't. We shall see!",3
"The media could not be loaded. I loved the fountain at first, it worked great for a while but after two months its on and off intermittently, even in full sun 🙄",3
It works only in sunlight. does not keep the charge to be in the shade. If you don’t mind having it for a few hours of sunlight this is for you. Because it’s in the sun it does require more water as it evaporates faster.,3
"It needs full on sunlight to work and I don't have that anywhere in my yard. During regular daylight, it spurts periodically. Kind of disappointing, but I bought another one from a big box hardware store and it does the same thing.",3
I liked the solar fountain and it's different spray options. It does not seem to work as well in less than full sunlight. After 3 months it suddenly died. We tested it for clogs etc but to no avail. For the price it is nice for the summer but don't count on yearly enjoyment.,3
"The media could not be loaded. I didn’t realize this was the same one I bought last time. It lasted about 6-7 months last time I bought it, which isn’t terrible for the price. My biggest issue is the ad clearly says their solar panel will work “even with a leaf on it” compared to other brands and this is simply not true. The moment any tiny shadow is on the solar panel, even in direct bright sunlight, if a tiny corner or anything is covered it stops working entirely. I’m already finding myself moving the panel constantly to keep it in the sun so I can enjoy the sound of running water. I decided to just return it for one with a battery back up since it’s only a few dollars more and they’re built to last longer and just work better all around.The pump/suction works well but these are not built to last. My last one worked for quite a while, but it very obviously wasn’t putting out the same amount of power after only about a month, even with cleaning it often.",3
This has a one year warranty & it quit working 8 days after warranty expired.,3
"I have been looking for a solar fountain for our 18’ above ground pool. We live in Central Florida so we have mostly strong sunshine. From the first time I put this fountain in the water, it struggles to spray 2 inches. If just a slight shadow crosses over it, it stops spraying, and struggles to regain an 1” or 2”. I even tied it to the side of the pool with some fish line to keep it in direct sunlight. I contacted the seller and they told me the sun may not be as strong now as in the summer 🤔 After several messages back and forth and troubleshooting, the seller offered a full refund. I will keep looking! I think this would be great for a bird bath, I need a fountain for an above ground pool! Communication from the seller is a 5 star ⭐️",3
"My location is not optimal so it stopped working,but with full sunlight and consistent cleaning once a week it does work",3
Seems to be clogged and I can't figure hiw to clean the filter. Directions seem to indicate pulling it out but it doesn't come out and I'm afraid of breaking it.,3
"Unfortunately with the size of bird bath we had the water would blow out and empty the bird bath fairly quickly. We tried different nozzle sizes but even the low bubbling ones emptied the bird bath. Others may have a different experience but I did read this in the comments as a primary concern for others, and the book describes several methods of helping to prevent this so obviously is an issue for others. Net, neat idea but for bird baths it's impractical. If you have a small fish pond or other water feature that's larger it indeed would work well.",3
"Our bird bath is located under some trees to keep the water cooler in the bird bath, so when the sun was out the fountain kept starting and stopping. The birds around my house were afraid of it. That might be because it was cutting off and on, but the birds abandoned the bird bath until we removed the fountain. It was unsuccessful at our house. We were hoping the birds would play in it, but it didn’t happen.",3
Two out of five attachments are missing still I'm keeping it. Fountain is working perfectly.,3
I have a bird bath that I put this in. The arms that stick out keep it from moving around and shooting the water out of the bath. It will work if the sun is directly out and over it but it can get sluggish if not completely sunny. The plastic piece gets clogged up sometimes so the fountain part doesn't always work really great. I guess it helps overall to keep the water moving.,3
Worked great until about 3 days after return deadline. Lights continued to work but pump stopped working,3
Pumps well for my fountain but get hot at outlet plug in!,3
"It is an okay pump but nothing special. received it today and added the connector(The one I bought locally) to the wires, that I need(It does not come with a plug-just 2 bare wires). Wiring is very thin. Am guessing 22 to 24 gauge wire. Really too small for a max 3 amp motor. Had to fix a loose connector from the red wire that plugged into the motor. The connector had not been crimped enough and was loose on the motor plug. Also noticed that the motor is not completely encased. You can see that on the description page of this motor. That is not good. No matter where this motor is installed(inside or outside), dust and moisture will get into the windings. It is not a waterproofed motor and does not claim to be. I will be using mine on a 15 gal sprayer pump pulled behind my lawn mower. Dust will get into it and I have to be careful if it starts to rain while using it. As stated by other reviewers, the 2 small clamps that come with it are useless. Go buy a decent pair, if you cannot reuse the ones on your bad motor. I also have to reverse the motor/pump 180 degrees from the old bad pump-as the water flow through it is opposite. All in all, it is not bad for $22.00. Will install it tomorrow and see what the pressure is like. If I can get 6 months use out of it, I will be happy. 6/25/2018--Installed motor/pump today. Will have to buy another piece of intake line(From inside of tank to input plug on motor) due to having to reverse the motor position 180 degrees. Intake line is now about 8 inches to short. Pressure is not bad but not real great either. It will do what I need it for but would not recommend this motor. 7/22/18 edit-Pressure turns out to be pretty good. After 2 uses, had to turn down the pressure as I was going through too much weed killer to quick. Nice pump but the exposed windings are my main issue...",3
Have gotten two pumps so far and they only last a few days before quitting.,3
"I wanted to love this so much! The directions were easy to follow, set-up was a breeze, and it made a beautiful fountain. My plan was to plant flowers along the perimeter of a large pot, then put a smaller pot in the middle for the fountain. Unfortunately, the pot I used is too small in diameter (8”), so all the water splashes out of the pot and it runs out of water too quickly. It even splashes over the side of the larger pot on the bottom, which is 14” in diameter. I went through 1.5 gallons of water in about 1/2 hour. I’m bummed this is so impractical because it looked so good. I’m going to see if I can find something wide enough to contain the water so it can be reused instead of splashing out.",3
"The thing about this pump is it requires perfect conditions to operate. A spot that you know is going to be sunny (Clouds permitting) at as many hours as can be. However, a butterflies shadow will interrupt the panel and cut off your pump.",3
"The pictures do it no justice, it was just way too small for what I needed it for",3
"All solar products I've ever experienced have 1. Diminished productivity with lower light levels; 2. Advised ""full sun"" by the manufacturer.These fountains work fine when the solar panel is completely sun-exposed. But there is no useful in-between. Even a 10% or less shading allows the pump to cease operating. The sellers ad did not disclose this very well. I was under the distinct impression it would work just like any other. The pools in working with have shifting partial shade through the day. These pumps will spurt water only during brief periods of total sun, no shadows.",3
"This is a nice little fountain that works well. I mainly planned to enjoy it during the daytime so nighttime operation was not a big deal. That’s good because the battery power doesn’t last that long. The worst part about the fountain is the weight distribution. The fountain motor and battery are all on one side of the fountain, causing it to tilt sideways. I have yet to attempt to add Wait to the other side to balance it out, but this is a design issue to be aware of.",3
Ok product didnt compare at all well in a pond to similar priced solar pumps with a panel.,3
"This is an ok solar fountain. It works fairly well in full Sun, however, anything less than full Sun and it doesn’t do anything.",3
"This tiny pump can lift the water column in 1/2 Vinyl Tubing 5 feet, not 5M (Five Meters) as advertised.For what it is, it's fine, and a deal.",3
"We have tried both this filter and the box filter and both work pretty well with some drawbacks. The biggest complaint is that although we use the largest 1900 gph pump, the largest corrugated pipe and that is connected to solid pvc piping, the connector from the filer to the pump is only 1” diameter. This cuts down on the flow of the pump drastically and thus makes for a smaller waterfall. The cylinder prefilter needs to be cleaned frequently! We don’t have fish to make the pond dirty, but get a lot of pine needles and pond worms in it. The box filter can go quite a long time without maintenance, but it is hard to make it stay on the bottom of the pond. I fill the box with 5 small rocks, but sometimes it will still rise to the top and cut off water intake to the pump. It is also difficult to screw it onto the pump with the rocks inside. If I cannot find a way to attach larger tubing to each of these devices, I am going to try putting the slotted cover back on the pump and place the whole pump in a mesh bag.",3
"This unit has leds for night, but I'm 4 days with abundant light, the LEDs peter out before dusk.The pressure is ok but not like the pictures at all.",3
Good product and nicely made would have given 5 star but instructions where not good had to figure out in my own and the cord is short so limited to where I could put,3
"I was replacing my existing pump thought I had ordered same one, but once I hooked it up realized it didn't go have a on off switch like my old one.",3
"This worked great at first. With a full birdbath it worked fine, but as soon as the water level dropped at all it didn't work. Also, the holes are so tiny they are easily clogged. So it's cute, but you get what you pay for.",3
"Great design to keep in center of pond. Color is really good, but the water flow in the fountain sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Disappointing",3
For some reason these don't last that long,3
"This solar fountain is super cute and met my needs to keep water moving in a water trough for our wildlife. It worked for 5 weeks then stopped pumping. I've cleaned and changed the filter, disassembled, cleaned, and reassembled as suggested in the user guide with no luck. I've reached out to the seller to see if it can be replaced under their 3 month warranty.",3
"This pump, well pumps. It works great. However it makes a lot of impeller noise. As a result the pump had to go back.If you have an application where it is not important that it be quite i would highly recommend this pump.",3
"I had this pump in my fountain for 3 weeks and it completely stopped working. It's not clogged or damaged, the motor just stopped. Of course, it's right outside the return window...so I guess they got me there.UPDATE: IM UPDATING FROM 1 STAR TO 3 BECAUSE THE SELLER DID ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE SITUATION RIGHT WITH ANOTHER PUMP, BUT I HAD ALREADY BOUGHT FROM A DIFFERENT RETAILER.",3
"The ad said good for koi pond, but it's tiny! Good for a bird bath maybe. None of the connector pieces actually fit into each other, so we had to jerry rig it to make it work. If my husband wasn't as handy as he is, I would have had to return it. Surprisingly, it shoots a pretty big fountain of water! The led lights do not fit under the fountain head and only sit in the water at the bottom right on top of the pump, but it still looks pretty at night. I give it one star for assembly, but 4 stars if you can actually get it working as it does the job and it's a good price.",3
I am not very impressed with the power of this pump I can barely get it to pump water was,3
I received these on Sunday and used 2 right away. It is now Wednesday and as of this morning 1 is not working.,3
"The plastic stabilizers could be a bit longer. Too short even for a bird bath. When first installed, the pump will not be consistent. I was told to fully charge the fountain for a couple hours and that worked.",3
"Directions were not clear, but it works well. only thing i can’t understand- i have a fairly deep birdbath, and after a little while, all the water is almost gone? why?",3
"Keep a watchful eye on this product. Purchased for bird bath. Must constantly provide water or they do not work properly. Used in a pool, it could drain your pool, be careful.",3
No longer floats level after about a month lights dont work and now the tube I. The middle blew off and the fountain cannot work without it. Pump works but that all.,3
owned it for over 1 year for a 125g pond. after 1 year the pump loses power. now its pumping half the water it was when it was new. i cleaned it hoping it would help but it didn't change. i bought different pump to replace this one as it seems like its on its way out.,3
"Ordered in hopes it had enough lift but sad to say it did not. Thought they may be strong enough, but no luck. No fault of the pump. So had to return them",3
"I loved this fountain, and it worked great === for awhile. All of a sudden it stopped working. Took it apart and cleaned it. Left it in the sunshine to charge up--- nothing. I have had this less than a year (purchased in August 2023) and am not happy. Should last longeer than a few months.",3
"The media could not be loaded. Would have been 5 stars when new because it looked so nice; but, it hasn’t lasted as it should with the intended/original features.I loved this last summer when I got it. I was happy that I spent the extra money over previous fountains. The colors & fountain at night were truly beautiful.BUT by the end of the summer, the lights didn’t change like before…. Not in a consistent sequence that lit up the water spray as colors changes. It still worked as a fountain & lights did come on, but disappointing by the end of the summer. It’s like the lights were dying (fizzling out? Shorting?). A couple of the small light sections (not sure what to call them) don’t change color…. They’re colored, just don’t change or project.I’m still using it. I cleaned it (as I’ve done before). Lights come on but they’re hit or miss & nowhere near as ‘magestic’ as before. It was so cool!I want another one because it made me happy last year, but I don’t want to spend the money every season.I’m compelled to write a review now because I was initially very happy with the purchase, but when I see it now I’m disappointed. I understand there was a year warranty & I missed that window, so obviously my neglect there.I’m sharing pics from last year. The fountain would be all one color, then change to the next color. Now (pic/video taken 7/20), the fountain works, but the lighting isn’t what it was.So, I’m conflicted in my recommendation…. Really nice/fun at first, but won’t last.",3
"This may not be a fair review, but I can only report my experience and let the readers reach their own conclusion. I have a 4,000 gal. pond, presently with no vegetation. I do live in an area subject to substantial wind blown debris (leaves, seed pods, mown grass, etc.) too numerous to effectively skim from the surface. Therefore, the pump is clogged with both large and small particles and must be cleaned on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. My pump is a Little Giant, rated at 3,200 GPH., with two discharge ports, one to the filter the other directly to the waterfall. This splits ths discharge into two equal, more or less, quantities of 1,600 GPH. The filter's internal parts further reduce its discharge to about 1250 GPH.I was sure bagging the pump would solve the large debris problem, but immediately on enclosing the pump and placing it back on line, the discharge was about one-half its unbagged quantity. Seems the mesh of the bag in itself was acting as a blockage by small debris. I left it to run for the next 24 hours. That evening we had a tremendous storm which resulted in flooding the yard and washing soil and other debris into the pond. Later I noticed the pump discharge was a trickle. When I lifted the pump from the pond the bag was completely covered with soli particles which were blow or washed in by the preceding storm. Good news is that the pump itself was clog free, so I guess I could say the bag did its job to protect the pump.End of story, this may be the answer for those with a small, debris free pond. If you do decide to bag you may want to increase your pumps discharge. if you are in an area such as I, and/or you cannot increase your pump's capacity, you may wish to avoid the bag. For a small pond, easily skimmed of debris, the bag might work.",3
"Fountain runs strong. There is no way to secure the fountain to the foundation provided, or to the bottom of the pond. Suction cups would have been brilliant! Have it propped up with rocks but a breeze will likely blow it over :-(",3
"This is a very good pump relay but avoid putting it with an Orbit controller as it may initially work but will fail to engage later in service. I believe the Orbit products do not put out the required amperage to engage the relay and you will get a ""double clunk"" as it tries to engage and the Orbit timer will indicate pump failure.",3
"Bought to wash my dogs with warm water in the back yard. No included hose adapter. Other users report that a 3/4-IN MHT x 1/2-IN FIP adapter will work to connect a hose. This is false. There is no standard off the shelf adapter to convert the discharge threads to a garden hose (MHT) male fitting. The only solution is to buy a sacrificial hose and attach to the barbed adapter included with the pump. I used a 15' 5/8"" $15 garden hose from lowes attached to the smallest adapter. Pressure was barely adequate for washing the dogs.",3
This was amazing when I first used it. I changed a nozzle that didn’t work for my display and went back to the original and the fountain hasn’t worked the same since. Most of the time the water spouts but the lights no longer work. Bummer!,3
"The Biling Solar Pond Aerator with Battery Backup, 3 Modes Solar Air Pump Hydroponics Air Pump, Solar Powered Pond Bubbler for Outdoor Fish Pond Stock Tank Aquarium works, it puts out bubbles but slightly. I wouldn't go to deep or the bubbles would barely blow. I would put it in a 10-15 gallon tank not a pond. I replaced this pump with one that burned out. The burned out pump I had running would churn the water as if it had undertow ripples. This pump barely moves the water with it's highest settings. I'm going to keep this pump because I like the fact it runs on solor, so far it comes on when the sun comes up and runs for a while after the sun goes down. For this reason and this reason only I'm going to keep this pump. Would I recommend this pump for a deep pond or tank no!. But if fishing and you want to keep the fish alive yes it would be great for that. Otherwise no, I don't recommend this pump for ponds and deep aquariums.",3
"This controller has little impact on my 2.8 Amp 3/4 HP pump. I think the current draw of the motor has to be higher than mine is for the controller to slow it down. This slows my pump a little, but it also starts making a worrisome noise when i use it for that. I just leave it on full, and use it as an on/off switch for my pump.",3
"The media could not be loaded. Like the title says, it works but is surprisingly loud. I'm using it as a coolant pump for a CNC router, and imagine that some people use it to cool their CPUs, so it's likely in their bedroom, so be aware. The video doesn't do it justice - that's as quiet as it gets. If I lower it to the bottom of the bucket it gets much louder. Will be contacting the seller to see if this is ""normal"", or if I got a dude.Edit: The manufacturer was initially very responsive, agreeing that it's loud, asked for pics, and asked me to check several things. I did, reporting back that water was squirting out the sides of the pump, and asked if that's normal, or is a gasket missing - they never responded. I asked again - and again, no reply. So... it's going back, and I though I have no proof, suspect that they're all like this, and have ordered a different brand.",3
Good little fountain for the price. We fully charged the batter once received and it last about 3.5 hours . The lights are bright and definitely add character to our pool. The fountain is actually about 2ft in the air so provides a nice accent to the pool as well. Happy that we purchased. Definitely would not cool an above ground pool down much during the Texas summers.,3
"The product itself was acceptable, however the power of the fountain was disappointing. Didn't find it was very tall at all.Thanks!",3
"Im updating a fairly negative review I previously left. Although it's definitely not ideal that blunt end wires have to be connected and it would be helpful to have a manual showing how all the parts go together, the owner of the Amazon store contacted me directly after some not super productive correspondences with Amazon chat and provided clear answers that showed a strong understanding of my question and the product along with offering a substantial (and id say generous) partial refund on the product. Id stand by my initial complaints about it the kit requiring wiring and not having good instructions for combining the separate parts, but in the end I did receive good customer service and the issue resolved.Initial Experience:I don't know if the system works. If you order this you will receive a solar panel, some additional wires, and a pump with their own manuals but no instructions on how to combine them.To connect the solar panel and pump directly requires connecting two blunt end wires which isn't a trivial task, although I'm sure it's super simple to people more experienced in this. Not only do additional connectors need to be bought, but when I've contacted customer service several times to have them recommend a connector or further guidance on how to connect the blunt end wires they just send me back a diagram showing that black goes to black and red goes to red, which is already on the listing, and doesn't help actually physically making the connection.Additionally, the pump came with a manual saying that intricate prep like greasing and pulling back the wire coverings was required for the pump or the warranty would be voided, but that had appeared to already be done for my pump (as confirmed by the company) but is another example of the materials poorly matching the instructions.I hope to get this working with only $15 or so in extra parts. After about 6 back and forth a with their customer service, I'm largely giving up on them and trying to make it work with friends with more electrical experience.",3
"The manual indicates that the company is to include some oring grease and possibly some other pieces for an electrical splice. The company never returned any of my calls asking about this. Also no wiring diagram is provided on how to wire the solar panel, battery and pump to the control panel as to which wires go where.",3
It was okay but not for my application,3
"I bought the small unit as a larger one I had ordered (same mfr) hadn't shipped after a week and Amazon couldn't tell me with any certainty when it would arrive. I had to cancel that one and get one that promised two day arrival. My rating is with the understanding the pump has only been running for a week now. So I am really not addressing longevity. I am using the pump in an outdoor fountain and for that I would say it is undersized. The description says it can pump to six feet and includes a fountain as a use. My 3 level fountain is maybe four feet high (and not that big) yet at full open it works but not much ""oomph"" coming out of the top, and this is brand new with no debris or hard water buildup impacting performance. I wouldn't go any less than something in the 400-600 GPM for an outdoor fountain if I had to do it all over again. An aquarium should be no problem. Also, pay close attention to the two connections that come with it. They are very small and if you are trying to connect to a threaded hard plastic pipe to move the water up to the top of the fountain, you are likely to have connection issues. The bigger pumps generally come with more connection adapters. This one is more suitable to plastic tubing. Other than that, size is nice and compact and it is easy to install and is quiet. I actually bought this brand for the dry burning protection. Only time will tell on that feature. So just pay more attention to the description and measurements than I did to make sure it will meet all of your needs.",3
"I've had my Aero Garden for about 4 yrs and this style pump always needs to be replaced like every 6 months, the last time I ordered it only lasted barely a month, but they sent a replacement so that was good, but they guarantee a 1 yr warranty which I wished I would have known, but I do now",3
"I ordered the green. Read the reviews about it being lighter than expected...yes, it is lighter - a soft silver-sage color (not too blue like teal/not too yellow like olive). I will be keeping as it works for my needs. I am concerned about the fold creases throughout. I washed it in cold and dried it in a cool dryer but they'er still there. I'm giving it time and then might try washing warm/drying hotter but I don't think it should be ironed (?). Quality it good though with a medium weight - more bedspread weight than light comforter weight/thickness",3
"The product was loved by my daughter. We had no issues, it connected easily, charged and the sound was good. Now that we had the product issues are arising. The right side is very low, I’ve cleaned it but it was rarely used because she used one side only. The left is not going on, doesn’t indicate if it’s charging and no sound is coming out. I’ve watched the video for troubleshooting but nothing complies to our situation. I know It’s been a long time but Im trying to connected to the company but there is no site to help. I just want to know what I can do to fix the problem. If they only last this long then that would really suck.",3
"I have not had these a year now two different luggage out of three luggage wheels are broken. All three liner are broken and inside zipper broke on two. The personal size I used once and the liner and zipper is broken. I would use these for a quick trip, don't expect it to last long.I ordered these for our vacation for spring break. The inside liner broke on two of the three luggages. On the big luggage the wheel busted while it was being unloaded out of the van. When my son pulled it out and it hit the ground the wheel busted off. The screws pulled through the plastic. I wasn't out there so I don't know how bad it it the ground.

"Five weeks, 11 time zones, 33,000 km by air, and 5,000 km driving overseas. <23 kg and <7 kg [for those who know the drill], but never needed to open the ""expansion zippers"" on either hard bag. Bought a *second* set for my 13 yo daughter, so this review reports on BOTH sets, which had similar problems.a) Nearly every screw on the extendable dragging / pushing handles came loose, the first one by the third airport. We scrounged a tiny screwdriver and kept resetting the things, but had not my farm-girl noticed the problem and fixed it temporarily with the nail-file on my toe-nail clippers, it would have been a huge PITA. Now home, we will reset all of them with Loctite. Too expensive for the Chinese manufacturers, apparently.b) Nearly every internal zipper failed, on all four ""hard-case"" pieces, and the only zippers on two of the four (much smaller) soft-case pieces. They split apart, jammed, and were generally uncooperative on a consistent basis. Inexcusable, since an extra 10 cents per zipper probably would have taken care of the sucky-quality problem.c) The fabric for the zip-close sections of the ""hard case"" luggage ripped in a couple of places. Annayance, not problem, but SHEESH, people, this is not high-dollar stuff I'm asking you to fix.d) The ""hard case"" is not as ""hard"" as suggested. I had one ""casualty"" even though well-packed and set to contain any mess.We'll keep using this luggage, since it's basiclly decent, but if you're a serious traveller -- like 150,000 or even 100,000 ... go up a notch for quality.",3
The luggage it self is sturdy but the zip keep give trouble to run smoothly. And the zip do not extend,3
"They seem durable, they look good it is the color I wanted, they expand well and hold a lot. I am currently using the carry on bag as my toiletry bag because I ordered a toiletry bag and it never showed up and the carry on works great as a toiletry bag. The lock is a joke I took them off and left them at my house it's like a child's diary play lock they don't weigh much at all. Now the cons. The handles that extend out seem week and flimsy like they will break any minute, the bags don't stand up well because how the wheels are and the zippers like to stick and when I got the luggage the zipper things were closed but the zippers teeth were separated (if that makes sense) all in all I am happy I got these when I did because if I got them a few days later I would have been pissed that I spent money on them. I bought these in desperation.",3
"This luggage look awesome, however they are not sturdy. My husband took them on his trip and I felt it was going to pop (not sure if the hoodies are too bulky). I did pack with the weight restrictions under 50lbs. The size is comfortable. Was not stop for the carry on size I guess it depends on airline & staff.",3
I loved these cases the first day I got them but then I took the large one on a international flight. When I returned home the zipper lock was broken (easily repaired) but the pull handle foundation was also broken in the body of the suit case. I was expecting it to be metal but it was made of plastic. The suit case functions the same way but I know in a short time that pull handle is going to fall off.,3
"The item is beautiful but not very good quality. Not easy to meave, to move the luggage you cannot bend. Always should stand straight. I would rate 3. Color and design good",3
This suitcase is small of course it is carry on size but it’s really cheap light weight plastic and very aware it does not zip to expandThe large bag that comes with it may save the day I’m sure more items will fit in the bag than in the suitcase,3
"OK its cute luggage but they way they have the inside zipper, you have to kind of fight with it to zip even when its empty. Not the smoothest rolling either. It's cute though",3
"I really wanted to love this set. But, the wheels don’t perform as they should.Rolling to & from desk at resort took more effort to keep balanced than should have.The inner packing bags were a nice plus.I will return if that’s an option. Only used 1X",3
Love the suitcases but was sent a Champagne color instead of the Cement Grey. Not exactly good business but the color is tolerable. Suitcases seems sturdy and the wheels are very quiet. Great buy BUT if getting the color you ordered is important to you I suggest you pass on this company.,3
"When I first opened the box, i noticed what appeared to be scuffs in the largest suitcase. Upon removing them from the packaging, I realized they had a ""protective film"" covering the suitcases. This immediately brought to mind the question ""if this is a durable finish why does it require a protective film?"" I began removing the film and encountered 2 primary issues. First, I have arthritis and chronic tendonitis in my hands, it has taken me almost an hour to get the majrity of the film off 3 suitcases. The film does NOT come off easily at all. Second, with out the use of something like a utility razor, there is NO way to get all the film removed (see pics). The film simply stretches and tears to shreds when you try to remove it from the edges and fasteners. I would prefer to not have to take a razor or knife to my brand new suitcase before I even have the chance to use them. So my brand new suitcase set looks quite ragged, as if the finish is peeling. Why, if a protective film was necessary for shipping, did the manufacturer not make certain the film was not trapped under every edge of every fitting to allow for full remaval. And if the manufacturer was confident in the durability of the finish, was a protective film necessary in the first place? Another concern is they feel rather cheap. There is a flimsiness to the structure and fittings that does not inspire confidence. Also, there are no included instructions on how to reset the lock codes from 0-0-0. My next step will be searching online to try and figure out how to reset the codes for some degree of security for my belongings.On a positve note, the color is lovely as is the current finish and design. The zippers, handles, and wheels all move easily. They are lightweight. And they were inexpensive.As a side note, I bought a simlar set of a different brand for my son at the same time I bought these for myself. The price of the other set was comparable. It felt much more durable and did not have a protective film. My suggestion to anyone looking to purchase a new suitcase set is keep looking. There are other sets in this price range without the hassles I have encountered simply removing these from the packaging.*I travel several times per year for work and pleasure. If I don't forget, I will update my review at a later date once I have put these to use a few times.",3
"First of all, the luggage comes wrapped in a plastic film that took me 2hours to get off, had to use an exacto knife around corners and edges to remove. Once off, luggage shines beautifully. Very cute set (I get a few compliments in the airpots when people see them) but not well made. Very thin plastic shell, wheels cute but too small for luggage to maneuver smoothly, if luggage is packed to the max it tips over when trying to roll. Ive taken all three pieces on two trips now, by the second trip, on arrival the smallest luggage, the plastic around wheel was busted after I checked it under the plane. These also do not expand or have a tsa lock. If you want cute luggage, go for it, if you want luggage that's going to last and be reliable I'd look elsewhere.",3
I'm using the luggage for the first time and the handle is very flimsy. I may be returning,3
Thin flimsy plastic. Easily dents and leaves a crease. Maybe it will survive one flight,3
"This set seems to be durable enough to last for several years, but not the strongest luggage set I own nor have owned. We purchased another name brand set for my wife which had a slightly different locking mechanism that felt smoother and stronger. Have returned this set for these reasons and will be purchasing another set. Looks good and will probably work for some. Good luck if you do.",3
"first trip, one month old, and already the top handle and one zipper tag is coming off the big luggage. Not impressed and 30 day return policy is expired. waste of money. too bad, they are light, roll easy, and look nice.",3
"UPDATE: After spending a significant amount of time looking into warranty information on this set, I've discovered that this is NOT true Travelpro luggage.It's made by Travelpro, but it turns out it's a low quality set made for discount retailers.

"Loved this set when I saw it and HAD to have it. It was even prettier in person when I got it. That’s the good part. The bad part far outweighs the beauty of it. If you’re going to use it on vacation make sure you bring two other bags because these hold nothing. Normal suitcases have 2 sides you can load up stuff in, this one only has one side and half of it has the metal roller bars in it and the other side had a “net” that you put some nail polish bottles in it and MAYBE a book if it wasn’t a big book. For a normal four day trip I had to bring all four suitcases, (I bought the big one which had a little one in it and then I bought the smaller one which also had a little one in it). Then, if you’re dumb enough like me and brought it on a plane and let the thugs that throw around your luggage, Will most definitely ruin it. The very first time I used it, when I got to my destination and saw what was left on my bag that came off the carousel was unbelievable! It’s seriously looked like I had dragged it around for years. All the rose gold snaps and locks were all scratched up, the white straps that snap close, one of them is gone. it’s so flimsy and so not durable that I would say the only thing it is good for is to make your room look prettier. It’s not super sturdy, the rollers were not very good, I had to lift it over every threshold because it wouldn’t go over. I’m keeping the two little bags for carry-ons but the other two are ruined. So don’t spend 250 or $500 for this beautiful luggage unless you’re just leaving it out for show So you will not be as disappointed as I was.",3
"I ordered this luggage as the price point was great, and it would be here on time for a work trip. It arrived on time, the packaging was great, and the luggage looked wonderful! The color is a bit lighter than expected, but I really like it!! I used the med sized bag for my trip, it held everything i needed and rolled great! Unfortunately the durability just isn't there. I had a direct flight (only 1.5 hours) and when I picked up my bag, it was already damaged. There is a hole and a couple gouges. I didn't expect it to be perfect, but this seems like alot for such a short trip!! I couldn't imagine what would have happened on a long haul, or if this was on/off loaded multiple times. I understand now, why quality luggage is much more expensive. You definitely get what you pay for!",3
The product itself is cute. Feels nice to the touch & as pictured. The sound is fair for an affordable electronic. Nothing fancy and gets the job done. The cons did drive me crazy. I needed to sync them to my iPhone all the time. This is especially true when I use it one bud at a time. They also provided the wrong charging cable. I received a micro usb and not a type-c. Overall an okay experience with these.,3
"They came on time bought for the blue and red color as advertised for my 7 yr old grandson, comes with 2 sets, however the EarPods are white. Too late to return but hopefully he won’t be disappointed and think I ordered the wrong one.",3
But they were a little smaller for his ears,3
"Sound quality is good for the price, connecting to Bluetooth was easy, and they are the perfect size for kids",3
"My dog chewed them up, they stopped working before then and now they won't even connect to anything",3
"Not good for small ears. I couldn't get them to comfortably stay in, and every time you push it back in your ear it activates the pause or play setting. Getting both simultaneously paired, connected, and on was also kind of a mysterious pain. Sound was fine when in. I wish there was a kid or something as it is easy to push them out of the mag charger.",3
The touch part is really sensitive. And they dont sit in the ear. They kept falling out no matter how i placed them. Sound was still good. Perhaps it was a user error on my part.,3
It sounds like POOP,3
"The media could not be loaded. When I first opened it, it came with a little scratch even though it was brand new, wrapped in plastic so I have no idea how that happened. I bought it because has such a cute design, the earphones fit snug in my ear and are overall comfortable, noise canceling as well.After maybe almost a month or so using it, the right side just suddenly… stopped working?It works well when you use it but putting it back in its charging case is the problem. The magnet seems to just be rejecting it and the connection keeps interfering with other Bluetooth devices even though I disconnected it several times; I had to “forget device” in order for it to stop completely. I’ve wiped it clean, I tried to press it back in place, I just don’t know what to do at this point.If you want to buy simple, inexpensive Bluetooth earphones, might I suggest not getting these.

The day after i put them in and my left Ear bud kept beeping. The battery was at 10% after being in the case for 2hrs i noticed it still wasnt charging. I noticed on the bottom the connectors arent evenly placed which is causing the ear bud not to charge or hold a proper battery life.",3
The ear pods are really cool but when I bought them only the right earpiece works and that made me really sad but it still is a coll thing.,3
"I was drawn in by the photos that showed the Fanta can-sized case, but it turns out that picture must have been photoshopped. I was expecting something the size of a mini Coke can, which would’ve been perfect for my car's cup holder. Unfortunately, the case is much smaller than that, which was a letdown.As for the earbuds themselves, they work fine, about what you’d expect for this price range, but they’re not exactly premium quality. The case is cute, and it comes with a very short USB-A to USB-C charging cable, instructions, and the earbuds themselves. They start charging as soon as you put them in the case, and they don’t take too long to power up, which is nice. The soda can case has a USB-C port with a rubber cover and an indicator LED to show the charging status.The touch controls on the earbuds are simple—one tap to play/pause, double tap on the right to increase volume, and double tap on the left to lower it. They fit snugly in my ears and don’t fall out, but don’t expect any sound isolation.All in all, the product photos were a bit misleading, and I feel a bit tricked. If I had known the real size and quality, I wouldn’t have bought them.",3
"This pair of diet coke earbuds has ups and downs.The earbuds comes in a branded box as shown in my first picture with the soda can charging case, pair of earbuds, instructions/information paper, and a very very short USB-A to USB-C charging cable.When you put them in the charging case they immediately start charging and don't take terribly long to charge. I haven't used them a ton but that will come in my downsides. The top of the soda can has a USB-C charging port covered with a rubber cover and it also has a indicator led next to it to show if it is charging or finished.There are touch controls on the ear buds, such as tap once to play/pause, double tap on the right to turn the volume up and double tap the left to turn it down.The earbuds actually fit and stay very well in my ears without coming loose but there is no sound isolation or anything on these.Moving to the downsides, as I just mentioned there is no sound isolation or seal that this forms in your ear so you will hear everything around you and if you have these loud enough, anyone around can probably hear what you are listening to as well. That also brings me to the sound quality, it's just not great. Using a 20$ ""gaming"" headset produced better clearer sound with more bass than these could produce. I also noticed a few milliseconds of delay between what I see and hear if I connected them to a computer.The soda can isn't the easiest to open to put these back in for charging. There is little to nowhere to grab and because the magnets are good, it stays sealed.For some reason when you use these earbuds via Bluetooth, they ALWAYS are flashing blue on each ear bud to signify they are connected.Overall, not the best headphones but they are official and even in the bluetooth list they show up as ""diet coke earbuds"" which to me is fantastic so I know what I'm connecting to. The sound quality just isn't the best, the soda can isn't the easiest to open, and the constant flashing blue lights on the earbuds isn't great either. However, they do fit my ears very well, the touch/tap controls work as they should, and they last a decent amount of time just listening to music and other audio.",3
"There is a picture where they detail the measurements in millimeters, and in that same picture they show the can in someone’s hand but it must be photoshopped because I got the sense these were the size of a coke mini can. That was kind of what I was hoping for; not that the earbuds would be ginormous, but that the case, sitting in my cars cup holder could be mistaken for a coke. These are too small for that.Otherwise, they work fine. They’re as good as anything in this price point but not much bigger than other earbud cases.While the words didn’t technically lie, I find this product page a bit misleading based on the photoshopped product shots. I’ll own my part in falling for it, but is that how you want to buy products? Knowing what I know now, I wouldn’t buy again.My rating system breakdown:1 Star = Safety hazard, gross misrepresentation of product, or flat out doesn't work2 Stars = Needs improvement3 Stars = Meh, likely wouldn't buy again.4 Stars = Meets expectations5 Stars = Exceeds expectations",3

I was expecting at the price just the enclosure and nothing else (except a decent manual which is mandatory).Pro: affordable, comes with partsCon: you get what you paid for, Damaged port, Piss poor user manualTip: Dont use this for important data.

HDD Enclosures are always confusing as there are so many available in the market with so different ways of connecting peripheral/auxiliary devices. I went through a large list of HDD Enclosures and after couple of days purchased this item - waited for couple of days only to find out that this enclosure does not fit my internal hard disk. The board had some soldering blemishes but never had a chance to test the connectivity. The build looks pretty ok and it was a great ide to include the screw driver as part of the package - It was really helpful. Be sure of what Hard disks you are using - SATA is common these days. I ended up buying a SATA to USB cable that served the purpose of transferring data from my old hard disk to a newer one. This product may be good for the price advertised but ensure that this one serves the purpose. This would fit only HDD of laptops cos its 2.5inch and would not work with the bigger solid state drives - the ones which are normally used for desktop,3
"The device works, but you have to be careful with it. The IDE connection is not very deep and doesn't seem to be reliable. On the top of that, IDE connection is the only thing that hold the drive inside the case. While I am moving around with enclosure, I can hear the hard drive rattling inside.The Enclosure is OK for the stationary setup, but would not work for any mobile tasks.",3
This product is not for you if your going to use this as you primary portable hard dive. The only use for this enclosure is to retrieve data from another HDD.The solder joints are weak and look like their about to break.This product is not going to last very long so get a this is not for you if your going use it long term.,3
"Apparently, not all 2.5"" laptop drives are the same, or perhaps what i have isn't exactly a 2.5"" drive (IBM Travelstar, DCXA-210000, out of an old Dell laptop(?)). It didn't fit in the aluminum case... real close, but no cigar. Maybe if this drive had ever so slightly rounded edges along it's length it would fit.Fortunately, this is acceptable for my needs. It electronically edge-connected to my drive & provides the USB2.0 interface, but i do have to leave the drive out of the case, naked / exposed. O-well. 'Works.Karl*----->",3
"First things first, this enclosure is not blue, as listed. It is silver, and looks very similar to my other enclosure, which causes me some confusion, and is why I bought (or attempted to) a blue one.Otherwise, it works fairly well. Can get a little hot since it lacks fans, but keep it off of any insulating surface and it's fine.",3
"it took me a few extra minutes to plug in my drive and the usb cable came with the drive didn't work at first, but I figure out that problem and now it works great. Quiet, fast and slim.The vendor sent me a replacement usb cable no extra charge.Thx.",3
"As an enclosure, it seems to work fine. I knew it was cheap; we'll see how it fares over a period of time.My only quibble is the cable. I don't mind the Y-cable for use with computers that need the extra connection for power. It's the fact that the cable is a nonstandard USB A-A. Almost every other USB drive is A-B or A-mini B. Why does this matter? Because if you lose the cable, it'll be a hassle to replace it. As a consultant I have a lot of external drives, and don't want to worry about keeping specific cables with specific drives.",3
"Well, i have had it for a while and it was working. But then my computer suddenly stopped realizing it was even plugged in. So i tried another computer, and then my laptop, but nothing. I think it may be the driver, but I am just warning you people that you need to be careful.",3
"This drive works as advertised, my issue comes from the fact that the connector on the drive is a USB A connector. This makes things a little tough if you lose the cable - because it isn't easily replaced with either a mini or micro USB end, or the standard USB B connector. I doubt I'll get another one - though once connected it did work as expected.",3
"Like the title says, it does what it needs to and nothing more. I had to et one of these to do a data recovery from my brothers laptop.The case itself is well designed accept for the back plastic cover. It will take some jimmying to get it back on once the harddrive is installed in it. BUT YOU CAN DO IT.Also, don't loose the original usb cable. Its not proprietary but its a cross-over USB.Performs as expected and costs almost nothing compared to the alternatives I've seen in the past",3
"Works fine with Windows XP but unfortunately I bought this to access data on my old drive from a computer using Windows 7. Windows 7 says the drive is invalid and only give me an option to format it. Odd too since the data on the drive was all created in Windows 7. I have not yet tried that because I wanted to pull some data off of it first. I had to connect it to my work computer that uses Windows XP and share over the network to pull data.On a side note: this comes with a USB cord that has three plugs and no instructions at all on which one goes to enclosure, which one is supposed to plug in or if it even matters. One of the plugs is longer and thicker my guess is that one is for USB ports that are further away from where you want to put the drive but then I don't know since there are NO INSTRUCTIONS.",3
It has teenie-tiny phillips screws to hold in the top. Had to stuff some folded paper down inside because the case is longer than my HD and it kept sliding back and forth. The did supply a little phillips driver for those screws but the head of the supplied driver was way too big for the screws. What a joke. It worked once mounted and modified but it should have some foam or something to account for different length HDs and some click-in type of mounting instead of screws like those that are in your glasses. These screws are going to get lost and screw into plastic directly so eventually will strip out its socket. It does have a nice slip-in case and sleek color.,3
"This product was easy to set up and install. With a DVD it has pretty good surround sound and appears to be well balanced. The wireless rear speakers work well.

"This book provides examples of how to do certain special effects.It was definitely more of a ""tips and tricks"" book than it was a learning resource.

Most photoshop gurus will just scoff at this book, and most newbies will walk away amazed, but no smarter about photoshop than before they read it.The latter portions of the book was nothing more than a summary of the different photoshop filters found in commercial filter packages. I question why thoese filters were even in the book; it seemed like advertising that does not benefit the readers.",3
"I absolutely loved the anime of Cowboy Bebop. This book is set in the same universe with the same characters. Their stories, however, have changed. The way we meet Ed, Faye, Ein, and the history of Spike and Jet are different based on the author's take on the characters. Some might not like this, but I like the new twist on their relationships. Plus the author has added a whole new badguy! Since the TV series is over, it is also like getting all new Bebop stories. I haven't read the rest in this manga series so I don't know how they continue, but if you are dying for more Spike and don't mind the alternate reality, I highly recommend the book!If you don't want the stories to change, consider picking up the Cowboy Bebop series by Hajime Yadate and Yutaka Nanten, ISBN#1931514917, simply called Cowboy Bebop Book 1 etc. These are more like continuing adventures that take place in between what would have been a TV episode.",3

"i like RBL and Black-C a lot. Taydatay is my favorite from 11/5. So this combo made me expect a lot. Production is not as great as I would have thought, but there are some cuts (at least a few from black c) that dont sound too rapmaster keyboard-drum machine style. I liked the title track w/ big mack. taydatay/big mac collabo album would be good. as i said, the lyrics overshadow the production- sean t (he did this title track), ric roc (its hard 2 b-legit) have the best in the bay right now..",3

"Offutt's strength is his prose and characterization, but his narrative is a little off here. A shame really, because his first memoir was solid all around. He himself admits to not knowing what the Holocaust story has to do with his own return to Kentucky and, quite frankly, neither do I. It seemed thrown in as maudlin filler and was blatantly incongruous.The ending seemed rushed too. ""I am saying good-bye"" and ""I want to stay. I am ready to leave."" I know he can do better and the rest of the book proves that he can do better.Still though, there are some stylistic gems here. Offutt uses words and characters wonderfully. You'll love them and understand them. He's a very solid writer and students learning to write creatively can learn a lot from his craft--overtly and subtly.Worth a read.",3
"Three stars may be generous for the game. There is really only one way to consistently score: take the ball right to the hoop while using the ""juke"" moves. Short range jump shots don't work. Post-up game: forget it. Anything resembling a real basketball game: forget it. But if you do take the ball to the hoop and use the juke moves and you have one of the star players it is unstoppable. Play LeBron: he'llo score every time. If you like a pure arcade-style game then you might like this one.",3

"Among Arnold's early movies, this one stands out for the eclectic supporting cast. His early movies were remarkedly free of any acting on his part; I suspect he was still learning English then. But one way to make him look better is to hire nonactors, or miscast semiactors. Enter Wilt and Grace. (Later, Richard Dawson). This is as much a collectible as Terminator 2.",3
"""Conan the Destroyer "", this disappointing sequel to the entertaining and well made ""Conan the Barbarian"" is an example of what happens when studios attempt to broaden the appeal of a movie for younger audiences. This movie tries to inject more slapstick humor and includes ""big name"" stars (Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain), while sacrificing much of the story line, effective characters, and raw action that made the first movie so watchable. The special effects were also weaker and often seemed out of place, making this a real step backwards.If it wasn't for ""Arni"", it wouldn't be worth the price of the DVD. Recommended only for die hard Conan and ""Arni"" fans.",3
"After the succesful Conan The Barbarian the inevitable sequel took part 2 years after the first.This time Conan the Cimmerian(Schwarzenegger) must find with the help of a virgin princess a jewel that leads to the horn of a god Dagoth which a evil queen(Douglas) needs to give to their kingdom all the power of the world.Followed by the sorcerer of the first film(Mako) by a cure thief(Lester) and a agile warrior(Jones) they must face all the dangers of such a risky mission.With dign special and visual effects and the final monster made by the creator of ET the film has a whole dign production better than italian imitations(Ator) or cheesy and camp productions(Red Sonja,Barbarian Queen) and at least is entertaining and pleased to watch.",3

"Had eagerly awaited this one. Great movie, but the image quality was in no way up to BluRay standards. Not having seen it in the theater, I don't know whether this was by design.That said... Oscar-worthy.",3
"Everybody knows the movie is fantastic, and I'm sure the transfer to blu-ray is equally as impressive, but I received this product with a giant puncture mark through the case. There was no damage to the box, so I assume it had to be due to how the movie was handled in the warehouse. It literally looks like somebody attacked it with a screwdriver. Luckily it didn't damage the disks, but regardless it's still annoying.",3
I absolutely love this movie. I hate paying $25 for blu ray discs though as even with my top notch equipment it's just not that much better. I already have two versions of the dvd.. yeah i like it that much and wanted the blu ray basically cause the price was right. However i was disappointed as when i got it there was a golf ball type divet in the blu ray which wouldn't allow it to play. I unfortunately had to return it. I am giving this item a 3 star for midway though because i received fast service and it was extremely easy to return at no cost to me.So yes quality control sucked that this got out as it clearly couldn't play for anyone but Amazon customer service support was top notch for returns.,3
"I wasnt planning on watching this movie but decided to last minute. I saw it on the huge screen at IMAX.. special effects and action was great.. heath ledger was fantastic in the role as the Joker.. i had only seen him in romance and drama roles before this, but he really suprised me with this one. He really went out leaving his mark.If you're not a fan of his, or of the Batman series, you might not become a fan from watching this movie, but i do recommend giving it a chance at least. Its a pretty good storyline and even a bit scary towards the end.. i only bought the dvd for a friend, but i wouldnt mind watching it again.Definately watch it if you're a Heath Ledger fan though.. he was awesome in his role and you will love him in this one.",3
"This was a solid movie, but way too long. It was as if they kept putting in another scheme for the Joker to pull off...then another...then another. Why? They could have cut 30 minutes from the movie easily.I have to say that I was expecting much more from Heath. While his performance was certainly solid, it was by no means the oscar winning portrayal I was hoping to see. And for him to have said that the role was so disturbing that it was causing insomnia and a lot of his problems--he clearly had some emotional issues then, because the Joker was actually a lot more tame that I thought he was going to be. All in all a solid movie, but it was too long and over-hyped.",3
"Normally I'm pretty satisfied with my OtterBox purchases, but this one was a bit disappointing. Because the glitter case is clear, it's not made of a hard plastic like the others. For some reason I thought it would be a little harder but it's a flexible plastic. Also, as a side note, don't be dumb like me and use acetone or nail polish remover around this. I melted the side of it within the first couple of days of having it.",4

"This is a pretty sturdy, safe alternative to the traditional mandolin (though still use caution). Has several functions that all work decently for the cost. Good for a college student like I was - just starting out and wanting food simply chopped (not pretty). Bought it a while ago and kept it for about two years.It can have trouble cutting through tough veggies like potatoes and onions, so I needed to cut them in halves or quarters to cut them. Food gets very easily stuck, and is very difficult to clean out in the sink. Not sure if it’s dishwasher friendly, as I don’t have one.",4
"I love the nesting feature, but I am constantly worried about using a very high temperature while cooking. According to the instructions it strongly suggests to use a medium flame. Also, there is a weird grayish residue between washes on the bottom exterior of the pans. I think other than scratching each other that’s the reason for the felt dividers that came with the set. I feel like it should have one more large pot lid added so you can use multiple pots simultaneously. The cold storage lids don’t snap on, so they don’t feel secure when storing food in the fridge. Easy to clean both by hand and in a dishwasher.",4
"These have heavy enough bottom to not warp when cooking at medium-high heat. Come out clean from the dishwasher. As long as you don't dunk them in cold water when they are hot, these will stay good for a while.They are good for making omelets and sunny side up eggs; or even fried potatoes for a small family. Big enough well for deglazing and reduction of sauces, but obviously you don't want to make a bechamel sauce in these pans.",4
"I have a go-to set of mixing bowls that I love. But sometimes, especially during holidays and large cooking get togethers, I want to use a different set so I am not forced to wash and dry my set of 4 so often. So, in preparation for a large gathering weekend, I bought this set. I used many of the bowls and lids for the mass cooking adventure. I was pleased with the sizes and appearance of the bowls. I was able to use them for serving some dishes too. The lids worked well. I did not use the shredding feature so I cannot comment on that.I will note that the bowls are not thick or very sturdy. I hand washed all pieces so that they would not be warped. I saw in other comments that the kids warped over time. By hand washing, I suspect that won’t happen to mine. They are not thick, I emphasize. I do not plan to use these as my sturdy, everyday pieces but they will serve well as my secondary set. The metal is shiny but I suspect it will dull and scratch over time but that is just aesthetics. I love the bottoms as they do not move when mixing. For the money, this is a great set of bowls. I would not use them daily but I recommend them for back up prep and storing.",4
Nice sharp sturdy knife! Damascus pattern is not as visible in person,4
"Talk about being duped, read everything about this knife and was convinced it was made in Japan & sold in America, but alas, yes, sold in America but ""MADE IN CHINA"". I'm really getting sick & tired of this crap, AMAZON you need to lift your game & demand that these sellers display where the item is made!!!!!!! When I find an item that I'm tempted to buy it is the first thing I look for ""where it's made"" & if it's made in China then that's a NO GO for me because I've had to much CRAP from them & the quality is disgraceful, so if an item cannot display where it's made then I'll just move along or go without.",4

"Scissors are nice quality and do well cutting but have limited use due to difficulty of cleaning. These have limited applications because they don’t come apart for thorough cleaning. Any raw meat packaging or uncooked items that can easily transmit bacteria should be avoided as the bacteria can get trapped where shears are joined. Soaking or dishwasher cleaning ultimately results in rust as water cannot be totally dried. Because of this , they’re not truly all purpose and I will need to invest in another pair that can come apart.",4
they work great and are solid! sometimes they come defective where the red string is glued and it ripps the bags.,4
I wanted one with a stand to set up when entertaining a large group for a grab and go beverage option. The height is below waist level. It is folding table height. It did the job.,4
"Easy to clean. Does a nice job air frying and baking. I haven’t used all the features yet but so far it’s worked great. The only issue is the toast feature, which really doesn’t do a good job but no toaster oven does anyway. I use a toaster instead. Nice product.",4
"This quilt is not very thick nor is the nap very thick. It definitely has a nap, but it is very low and doesn’t dramatically change color when you smooth it against the grain. The loden color I picked is dark enough to pair with my purple throw pillows as my other comforters are dark purple. Because it is not very thick, it lays flat and offers a clean look on the bed. The shams are simple without frilly edges, but I like the look. The quilt is very thin; it does not really feel as if it is filled with anything, but it has a lot of weight to it so that it is sufficient for winter use. The California King size has plenty of length and width to cover my bed and even the top of my bed skirt - please note this quilt does not come with a matching bed skirt - so it looks smooth and finished when the bed is made. I do wish this set came in a dark purple and not the lavender they offer as I’d get that color in a heartbeat as I prefer this thinner but still heavy style of bed covering. I also like that it is basically the same on both sides so that you can reverse it and it won’t look “wrong”. And the fact that it can be machine washed and dried makes it a good option for someone looking for a flatter, less puffy look for their bed. My only gripe is that it wrinkles a bit.",4
This velvet quilt is nice. It is a but thinner than I hoped but it is nice and soft. My husband likes that it is thin but I get much colder than him. It washed and dried well when I got it. I didn’t notice any issue with stitching on my set. I think it is a nice snuggly quilt especially for those with texture sensitivities.,4
"Smells good, lasts a long time, calming.",4
Didn’t think I would like these as much as I do but they’re really nice and bright. Bright enough where I can sit in the office comfortably at night without the need of turning on the room lights. These also help with out with eye strain too that I’ve noticed when using the computer for long periods of time.Getting them up and running was a breeze and it also works just as well with Alexa assistant. Plenty of preset color options to choose from or you can make your own through the Govee App.Only reason I docked a point is because the double sided adhesive strips provided with the panels are abysmal. They lasted for a day before they started falling off the wall one by one. Had to order some 3M mounting tape to get these to stick so fair warning there.Overall I’m pleased with these and many other Govee products. Way more affordable solution compared to the other alternatives. I’d definitely recommend these.,4
"The lights are really easy to install with the app guiding you, it get nice and bright and works well with google home. I just Wish the app interface was a bit more user friendly and accessible.",4
This Reed diffuser has pleasant scent. I like how it has a decorative flower pattern not just sticks. It can be put in any room and the entire room smells nice. It comes in a nice box so it’s even perfect to gift to friends or family.,4
"I recently purchased the Reed Diffuser Set (Starshine1), and I’m really enjoying the fresh, pleasant scent it adds to my home. The fragrance is light and uplifting, with a nice balance that isn’t overpowering — it creates a calming atmosphere whether in the living room, bedroom, or even the bathroom. It’s the perfect scent for daily use and definitely enhances the ambiance in any room.The design of the diffuser itself is lovely and fits well with my home decor. I also appreciate the rattan reeds, which are stylish and functional. The aromatherapy effect is subtle yet effective, making it perfect for spaces where you want a gentle, consistent fragrance without it being too strong.My only minor critique is that I wish the scent-drawing straws (the reeds) were a bit larger. I’ve noticed that the scent doesn’t seem to diffuse as strongly as I expected, and I think larger reeds would help draw the fragrance out more effectively and fill the room with a more noticeable aroma. That said, it still works well for a more subtle scent and is a great option if you prefer a lighter fragrance.Overall, this is a lovely diffuser set with a great fragrance, and it’s a perfect decorative gift as well. I just wish the reeds were slightly thicker for better scent diffusion. Still, I’m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a nice, relaxing room scent.",4
"First off, they are much smaller than I thought they’d be. I’ve only used one, as I needed something to store my towels on in my bathroom. It’s easy enough to install but even following the instructions, it ended up lopsided. No one notices but me..but it bugs me. I don’t like how flimsy it feels. I wouldn’t trust it for anything heavy.",4
"Instructions were clear, and it was nice that it specified the size of drill bits needed. But with the included hardware there is quite a bit of vertical flex to the bracket once mounted as it comes with countersunk screws which the bracket wasn't made for. After finding one of my shelves in particular was too saggy, I bought new screws with wide flat heads (see picture) and they are much more secure.It would also be nice if there was an included way to secure the shelf on the bracket - it just slides on and off. I'm considering whether I want to glue it, or perhaps inset a neodymium magnet on the shelf back so it would hold to the bracket.",4
Love the design and the fact that it melts the candle without getting smokey or sutty. Much safer than an actual lit candle. Just be careful when handling once it's turned on. Keep out of reach of children and pets.,4
My only complaint is that the little basket for the toothbrushes is skinnier metal than the rest and it doesn't stay on the hooks as well. The rest of them are perfect and look really nice. They hold a lot more than what we have to put in them.,4
"These wooden art signs are each a different size. When you store them, they nest inside each other. They are meant to be displayed on a table-top. They do not have hooks on the back to hang, but there is room to add a narrow one if you wanted to. The graphics are simple, in red and blue on a white background, but perfect for baseball (especially if you have an All-Stars display!). The slogans are those that baseball fans all know and love and are pretty timeless. My son is on two baseball teams, so I display these on the sideboard in our foyer with his team photos during the season.",4
I have this wreath on the front door and it will work for the summer. I have other wreaths for the other seasons. I like the way it looks and am pleased with it. I have to agree with other reviewers that the bow is very flimsy. I haven’t changed it yet but will do so in the future. Other than that it’s a nice looking wreath at a good price.,4
I have placed this near a window and the light shines through beautifully.,4
Very cute but smaller than expected.,4
Awesome pc for gaming gets around 240-300 fps in fortnite and never freezes all of a sudden. I recommend as for a first pc-,4
Wireless charger and headset plug dosent work other than that great pc,4
I like the support team response to a small issue. The repair was swift and great workmanship. My son loves his gaming computer and the lights around the computer match his room decor.,4
"Bought this for my 10 year old son. It is fairly fast out of the box. Runs his current games (Minecraft, Roblox, etc..) with zero issues. Looking forward to him getting into more robust games in the future so I can teach him how to upgrade his computer. This gives us a solid base that fits all his current needs and also allows us to build as we go. Big bonus is the looks. He absolutely loves the looks of this machine (little too flashy for my taste).",4
"it’s definitely worth the buy for the money. I’ve been playing on it for about an hour and have had no lag when it comes to opening things downloading things or even watching videos. The only thing that it can’t do (which is why i gave it 4 stars) and if you’re looking for this don’t buy, but it does not record gaming videos very well, which is what I wanted when I originally purchased, but I’m still happy with the product because it runs most of my games very well.",4
"The pc is good, third gen I5 performs better than expected even tho ddr3 ram starts to show its age, its still reliable. I only added a low profile card, The GTX 1050Ti from Zotac. It can run GTA Online between 50 to 75 fps (I cant see more beacause of the 75hz monitor), Fortnite runs perfectly on Performance mode, high settings, expect a few stutters for the few first games. For the E-sports titles such as Valorant and CSGO you'll have no problem running them. Its a pretty good computer for the price to performance ratio. I bought my gtx1050ti from Facebook Marketplace for 65 CAD$. BTW, I bought a different mouse with side buttons from Walmart for $6",4
"My previous desk only accommodated laptop. I was gifted a PC and needed to find something bigger but simple, as I had limited space. This fit that description perfectly. It's sturdy, sleek and affordable. My favorite perk is the built in power connections that allow USB and prongs. The lights are great and I like to match then with my keyboard. Very happy with this buy.",4
"Easy to build, took me about an hour total, instructions are very easy to follow. The desk itself is pretty sturdy, and holds all of my gaming setup no problem, with a good amount of arm room.I would’ve liked the desk to to be one single board instead of 3 smaller ones you combine to make the desk. Also the shelf to hold my computer is a tad bit small, with about an inch of my computer not being supported by the shelf it’s supposed to sit on, but I don’t think it will fall off unless it is kicked or bumped hard.The LED lights do not come with a sticky back, and the ones provided aren’t very good. So I’d recommend going and buying some double sided tape beforehand!Otherwise I am very happy with the product and the outcome! Great value for its price point.",4
"Bought this mic strictly because I was in need of a mic, mic arm stand etc. But what's even better is that some of my friends have the more expensive microphones like blue yeti and the 100-200 dollar mics for podcasts/recording music etc. and this one is right there with them I feel like. Maybe i'll notice more fractional differences down the road but as a overall mic, its great.The voice quality is very clear, it sounds crisp, no cutting out, no distortion, just a smooth voice with very little background noise. I use it for gaming, talking with friends on discord, even recording some vocals to see what my voice can really do lol. I guess I'm a singer now! It actually sounds better than I thought.It has soft touch buttons to turn volume of the mic up and down, holding it mutes. It just feels like such a satisfying touch.The design is clean, its the same size all around basically, doesn't feel outdated, too big and cheap, it feels like $100+ mic made with good durable parts and nice edges. Love the basically all black design.Overall, like I was saying, now that I have the mic, I would have just paid that much for the mic itself but since I was in need of the mic arm stand mostly, I went with this. Also though, I got a shock mount which actually is nice for not hearing any noise from things touching my desk, etc. I didn't know the value of this until I tried with and without it. The mic arm stand is nice, does exactly what it needs to do, use to have a super cheap 10 dollar one and it just wouldn't move smooth and this one just feels like a crane and its nice.Definitly will buy again, going to pick another one up soon for my girlfriend, built her a computer recently as well and it will be a good combo to have.",4
It's a Christmas gift for my daughter so it hasn't been opened but the pricing and shipping were great,4
"Shipment was delayed supposed to come in on sunday came on Thursday. Did come in thought UPS not amazon. At first of putting in power cord and HDMI cord ( HDMI cord did work) it would not turn on, but after inserting and plugging the power cord of the xbox off and on several times it did eventually work and then turned on. When it turned on it did restart itself twice but after worked completely normal. After all that no issues came from the xbox. Games like college football and Jedi Survivor has worked smoothly and download speed runs fast. Actually would recommend especially during prime day. A Xbox S 1TB was 350 no shipping while this on prime day in 2024 was 400 with shipping so definitely worth but can be risky with all the other reviews in place. Risk it though because this is way more worth it.",4
"If you want the new gen Xbox’s but can’t get the X, this is for you.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this as a surprise for my son, as I was redoing his media room. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, but super multifunctional. He can charge many things on this device. We love the lights on it. You can keep it one solid color. You can change it to a rotation of the colors too if you like. This has been great for minimizing cords and chargers and cables. Also, it keeps my son from just tossing his headphones down in a chair. This actually helps them last longer.",4
"Well, I wasn't planning on getting an 8th gen console. I was really in the state of thought, that it wouldn't be much of an upgrade from 7th gen to 8th, like it was jumping from 6th gen to 7th, or 5th gen to 6th. But. I had to reconsider since there where games coming out for the 8th gen consoles I really wanted, so I went on ahead and pulled the trigger. You only live once, amiright? My opinion about the leap from 7th gen to 8th is not that huge, is still the same. It really isn't that much of an upgrade. Just the likes of Xbox One and PS4 has smoother textures and graphics, and can handle more AI and activity than their predecessors. But hey, we're reaching the climax of how much we can do with this technology so it's a given.Now, that I have my views of 8th generation out the way, lemme get to the main course. The Xbox One.I enjoy it. I'm still trying to work around it and get to know it. Know the little new features that is. It's kind of like a 360, but with more. More downloading than the 360 as well. Just to play a DVD, I had to download an app just to make it work. I know. It isn't about watching movies, it's about the gaming. But still. Since previous systems just let you pop in the disk and play your movies, without having to worry installing features is kind of the point. Pop movie in Xbox. Movie plays. Pop movie into 360, movie play. Pop movie into Xbox One. Opps! You've gotta download an app for that! I know it's free. I know it's quick. But it's still stupid. Apps also have a knack for freezing sometimes. Like the youtube app. I'll be in the middle of watching a video, and it freezes. And I can't shut the tab down. The only thing left to do is to shut down the console and turn it back on. Scrolling threw the dashboard has a bit of a lag to it vs the 360. Maybe do to more plastered content? I don't know. I know. Stupid thing to nitpick about. Grain of salt people. But I'm sure these things won't matter with a few more patches and updates.Now that I've got the kinks out the way. Lemme get to the meaty part. The gaming experience. I haven't put too much playtime into it. But so fair, I say it's fun factor is very good. I had a good time playing Forza 6. More games are on the way so I can give this system some more playtime and open it up. This is going to be short since I just the console a few days ago and I need to get more in depth. But so far. No problems with the gaming aspect. Kind of funny thinking back in 2013, people where saying the Xbox One wasn't ""for the gamers"". It most certainly is.physical durability.Unlike last generation, within I year I would start hearing horror stories of reliability issues with the consoles of old. 2 years has already passed since these consoles had been out, I haven't heard any REALLY bad problems with these consoles yet. A few PS4's and Xbox One's bricked at launch, but only a slim few. The rest of time was smooth sailing for these consoles. Sure. The Xbox One isn't the prettiest looking thing in the world, but certainly isn't the ugliest. Like the original Xbox, this thing was built to last. There are huge vents everywhere. From the top to the sides, so no worries about overheating from hours of gameplay. Plus, the thing is really quiet. It doesn't make a peep. Unlike the old Xbox's, the One is so quiet you could hear a fly fart. The 360's fan roars more than Mufasa from The Lion King. I love how I can finally have some peace and quiet, when I have a console on. That's a welcomed change. Controller is not that shabby either. Although the 360 controller will always be my personal favorite. The 360 controller feels better than the One's by leaps and bounds. But when not compared to the 360 controller, the One's controller is really comfy and fitting. No huge complaints there.The verdict.I've only had the Xbox One for a few days, and I'm already loving it. It's not perfect. But it's not horrible like some people want you to believe either. (I'm looking at you PS4 fanboys.) The Xbox One is a fine investment that will give its owner hours of fun playtime for casual and hardcore gamers alike. Don't be expecting huge graphical leaps with these consoles. But don't think it's under powered either. The Xbox One certainly has redeemed itself, after it's horror show of a launch two years ago. So many people expected it to fail, but here we are. People are warming up to it and nodding in respect for Microsoft and the Xbox One turning around for the better.4/5",4
"I've been obsessed with it since it arrived. The seemless user interface and sleek design is absolutely captivating. From 10 percent, the phone will take 4 hours to charge if you have a regular adapter. It will hold a charge for a great amount of time. Pairs very well with Echo Buds, which I also highly recommend for audiophiles who look for balance between their music and their surroundings. The phone does come alone, without the promo for the $100 gift card, so double check your cart to make sure you chose the correct option.Update on having the phone for two months:This one of the best phones out there! The functionality is superb. However, it can heat up when fast charging and when using a couple of high functioning apps at a time. Fast charge take an hour and a half. The phone does not slow down, but the heat makes the phone a little uncomfortable to hold after, even with a case.",4
"I got this smartphone as an alternative to a.) Getting my iPhone 12 pro scrubbed.b.) buying another iPhone.To explain, I got hacked while using my iPhone and my bank wanted me to get it scrubbed in case there was some sort of malware on it. So rather than driving 40 minutes and paying $190 to get that done along with the paperwork certifying it was done, I just bought a brand new Samsung A-15 from Amazon. It performs well and satisfied my bank. Price is probably the .ain't factor in my purchasing this phone. I think I owned a Galaxy S-21 before, and I like this A-15 better. It has no water resistance, one speaker, but it has decent cameras and is fast enough loading internet sites. It's a tad big and heavy, but the + side is a larger screen. There is no inductive charging, but it uses a 25 watt charger that makes charging relatively fast. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I think it's 5000 miliamps. I've had it last over 3 days, so that's a plus. If you are an iOS user and have Apple Mail, that can be challenging, but once you set everything up, it's no big deal.",4
"I received this yesterday and have tried it out for nearly 24 hours now. I will be using this as a back up phone.The pluses.Nice big clear and bright screen.I like the case and the color. It looks and feel quite decent,Good, responsive touchscreen with good colors.Good wifi and bluetooth. On screen keyboard is also easy to use.Large battery, I charged it to 100 % last night and its still at 70%Good sound quality and fairly loud speakers.Negatives.There is some lag but that is in comparison to my “high end” main phone but I consider it to be more than acceptable.The cameras have great colors are appear to be over processed.If this was for use as my main shooter, it would not be acceptable but for the bargain price, and considering that this is budget phone, both front and rear cameras will suffice.Not too keen on the side finger print reader, it does work and actually responds quite fast, I don’t care for the location.So as a budget back up phone, there are some negatives but I can live with them all.Not; the first two photos were taken with the rear came at high resolution. The third was taken with the front facing camera. The last two were taken indoors in a restaurant setting on high resolution.I quite like this phone. I had been considering a 5 year old phone for a back up…. It still had really good specs but I was concerned about the battery and how much longer it would work. Also there would not be any security updates on an older phone but this is from 2024 and has already done several updates since I first powered it on, and it is due to be upgraded to Android 14 later this summer. ( I mention this because there are surely other folks looking for a budget back up phone.)Also, since I don’t play any games, I cant offer any opinions in that respect.For a back up phone, its ideal and I recommend it!",4
A budget phones serves all your needs for a second phone. Bit slow.,4
"Except the provided wireless controller. The left control stick was not functioning correctly and the controller would shut off on it's own.No problem as i had perfectly functioning controllers on hand.The important part was the console itself which happened to function perfectly. No issues or hiccups. I can now enjoy my 360 games again as my old console has been dead for several months,...though it provided over 11 years of service....i hope this renewed unit can provide the same.",4
A liked it but was a little on the small side and only red color.,4
"3D best in a dark room, less dark equals less crisp design. Best to have at eye level or looking at it straight on, when deciding where to place.",4
My grandson loved this.,4
Definetly works but you have to apply so much and one coffee and your back to stained teeth,4
Definetly works but you have to apply so much and one coffee and your back to stained teeth,4
It lightens my teeth a shade after several uses. However when I skip any days using it my teeth go back to their normal coloring.,4
As expected,4
"I have been using this for a few weeks now, and have not seen any significant results. I do realize that there are a lot of variables, and people have different diets, different brushing rituals, etc. So maybe others will see more significant results. The taste is not bad in my opinion (slight mint flavor). I would personally not buy this at the current price point due to the lack of results for me.",4
"I wanted to try this toothpaste as I do not want to spend a fortune on tooth whitening, and because I wanted to try a milder version of the dark charcoal toothpastes that have been around for a bit of time now but shouldn’t be used everyday because they have the potential to damage the enamel.The toothpaste comes in a simple tube with a screw cap and an initially sealed opening. The expiration date is on the box it comes in and is well into 2026, so no worries about taking a bit of time to use this paste.Expressing the toothpaste is almost too easy as the toothpaste seems thinner consistency-wise than other toothpastes. It seems to do a good job cleaning teeth, and although I wouldn’t say it has a pleasant taste, it is also not a bad taste.Rinsing it with just a bit of water by swishing it around gets rid of the paste quickly and I must say I am surprised that all the grittiness from the paste washes out just like that. I am not sure about the whitening effect yet, but my teeth feel clean and my mouth refreshed after each use.",4
"We loved this when we first got it. Our kid has a hard time opening toothpaste caps but this made toothbrushing easier and fun for our 6 yr old. But after some uses, it gets clogged since there’s no way to actually get all the toothpaste out unless you remove and rinse it every time.",4
Tastes great. It will get stuck in the tube. Not happy about that!,4
"way too expensive for absolutely no reason, but it is the only one our toddler wants to use so....",4
"No he doesn't want to use any of the more mundane and boring easily gotten mint toothpastes, so here we have a winner! Fantastic packaging, swift delivery and great taste. This could be the difference for my 10 yr old having teeth or not by the time his 15! very happy.",4
"Right after I use it, I notice a difference, but not sure it lasts. I’m not unhappy with it… I just can’t tell if I love it. It’s a cheaper alternative to other products.",4
Really works for a quick teeth brightening! I use before a night out and it does a good job for a quick touch up. Doesn’t really have a taste.,4
"This is my second jar. The taste is something to get use to. The essential oils do not cover the taste. You have to get use to baking soda. The perks, it’s great for sensitivity. Clove is wonderful. No foam, hard to brush that way but you adjust.",4
"I'm not a cheap person. And though this stuff works great, I'll be looking elsewhere for a cheaper, but comprable quality.",4
"Some of the tablets have partially disintegrated in the jar or broken into bits which is unfortunate, but the ones that are whole work well, very strong minty flavors. When you chew the toothpaste up only chew like 2-3 times the toothbrush will do the rest for you. It's definitely different to get used to but it works.",4
"I wanted to like these. I didn't mind them. They suds nice. I just felt like they fell short. I would consider buying them again, but at the moment I am shopping around. They do clean your teeth, are better for the environment that tubes, and they're great for traveling.",4
"This product is well-made and has excellent form, but the function was off for me. That being said, the product description is accurate; it's an ear irrigation flushing system, nothing more, nothing less. The tip disperses three streams of water that quickly empty the water cup into your ear canal. For me, at least, the process was not messy as the exiting water fell into the sink and not on my clothing. There are two buttons on the machine; get familiar with their function and positions if you're operating the machine by yourself. Otherwise, you might accidentally increase the pressure or prematurely start the machine, spraying water all over your bathroom.Now, back to the function: I was expecting something more, like pulsating or spiral streams of water. I believe I have clean ears, and I did not see any earwax removed after using the machine. After using the machine, I was able to extract earwax manually with an ear canal scraping wand. I don't think water alone would remove this ordinary earwax unless it came into direct contact with a pressurized water stream. Since there are only three fixed streams, only three spots on the outer ear canal are directly exposed to the full stream cleaning effect; the rest of the ear is exposed only to a water flush. If you are the in the market for ear flush irrigation machine this is the product for you.",4
"This ear irrigation system is compact and portable enough to take with you on vacation. The water chamber is emptied out the spout in 3 streams of water that do not rotate, pulse, or in any way agitate the earwax. The water gets warm, but not really hot enough or strong enough to dislodge stubborn wax. But this is probably a good thing because if it was too strong or directed into the ear drum it might cause damage and we wouldn't want that. It is good enough to help warm and loosen the wax so you can get it out with a scraper or to help assist the stubborn wax to come out of your ear when you can't get it with an ear scraper. My son had a heavy wax build up when he was small and the irrigation system the doctor used was huge in comparison to this item. If I would have had this back then the process would have been so much easier. But just remember to take it for what it is, an ear irrigation system. It just heats up and pushes water into your ear. It isn't a jet stream or a power washer.",4
"Doctors were flushing my ears once a year, because of a family bend in the ear canal. Still not perfect but helps and is easy to use.",4
"They work like advertised. Its bristles are about as stiff as a hard bristled toothbrush. The different sized heads are useful as well. The smallest head was especially useful for corners. The only reason I didn't give this a five star is because I really couldn't use it with the Pink Stuff. The bristles or motor just wasn't strong enough to cut through the pink paste. It works great with Ajax or Comet, just not the Pink Stuff. (I love the Pink Stuff btw.)",4
I love the ear wax removal micro camera for getting the places and seeing what's built up in the ear. I have had really itchy ears so this is great to get in and help clean out the itchy areas without causing harm or losing the tip of a cotton swab. I love the accessory tools that come with this for extra cleaning ability.,4
"This Ear Wax Removal Tool Camera is great to have as getting the inner ear visual is super cool and it includes different tools to remove the wax. However, this is an easy way for people wanting to dig deeper and deeper into the ear, which can cause a lot of harm to the eardrum -- leave that to a professional. It's neat to own and, for other purposes, great to have a micro camera.",4
"My opinion is that this steam cleaner is perfect for anyone who is looking for a method of cleaning their house that does not involve the use of chemicals, particularly for removing tough filth and grime. The fact that it comes with a variety of attachments is a significant advantage since it enables the cleaner to be adaptable enough to deal with a variety of surfaces and chores. The fact that this steam cleaner is both lightweight and small is one of the things that I particularly like about it. I believe that the mobility of this product is a significant benefit, particularly when it comes to cleaning areas such as restrooms or even the inside of your vehicle. It is simple to transport from one room to another. The deep gray color gives it a sleek appearance, and the ergonomic handle makes it easy to use for extended periods of time, which is ideal for cleaning applications. I am grateful that it warms up in a relatively short amount of time; it requires just a few minutes to get ready for use, and I did not get the impression that I was waiting around to get started. The set consists of twelve components, which include nozzles, a brush, and attachments that are designed for a variety of surfaces. The results of using the little brush to clean the grout in my bathroom were extremely impressive, and I am quite pleased with the outcomes. Because of the pressured steam, I was able to remove the filth that I had previously battled to remove with more conventional ways in a short amount of time. I believe that the steam is strong enough to remove debris that has been adhered to surfaces without the need for an excessive amount of physical effort, and I believe that it makes cleaning more effective in general.",4
"Works very good in getting down in the vent area. Was surprised at how much lint it cleaned out, which is comforting as I don't want a dryer fire.",4
These are long which works well. I use one for cleaning the dryer vent. I’ve cleaned it from inside the machine & from the outside vent. I use the other for cleaning out from under the fridge & the oven. The only negative for these is that they are difficult to clean all the lint & gunk off of the bristles.,4
"The Holikme 2 Pack Dryer Vent Cleaner Kit is a game-changer for anyone looking to improve the performance of their cloth dryer and safeguard their home against potential fire hazards.

But the benefits don't stop there. This versatile kit can also be used to clean dust and pet hair under furniture and appliances, making it a valuable tool for overall household cleanliness and maintenance.",4
"I love that this bends at different angles and that you can use it as a short handle or long one. The quality is great and it is very sturdy. It doesn’t bog down at all while you’re using it trying to get grime out of corners but I feel like the bristles could have been better. After one time of use, the bristles were pretty bent up and some were coming out of the brush. It is pretty powerful and lightweight. It’s a great value for what what you pay for it. There are multiple speeds but I feel like the highest speed works the best. It definitely gets grime off of things without having to hand scrub them but if you have a tough job, it won’t work well.",4
"This item gets a 4 because it is a great concept, long pole with a head that shifts so you can clean baseboards and a reusable head that you can remove and clean. Well, someone can remove and clean, not me. The cloth is really stuck on there. The plastic head is very flimsy and unscrews itself from the pole as you use it. I had to stop and screw the head back in three times while cleaning the baseboards.That said, the baseboard cleaner does a great job on a difficult task. The head could be more study and the cleaning cloth easier to remove, but the concept is a winner.",4
"It is handy to do baseboards with but flimsy pole, lean too much on it and would break.",4
"This gizmo does save one from bending to clean the baseboards. I do have a complaint though. The cleaning pad is really difficult to remove from the unit as the Velcro is incredibly strong which makes it difficult for arthritic hands. Secondly, even though I squeezed the water out of the pad before attaching it to the pole, I found that, when applying pressure to the baseboards to clean them, water dripped out of the pad necessitating having to get down to wipe up the wet. The cleaning pad is made out of some unusual fabric and it does not want to hold the water you put on it.",4
Seems to actually work. Not painful. Easy to use. Would buy again.,4
"Smells like chemicals sorta, not super intense and it’s gone once it dries but still, not what I would expect. It does peel really well and my skin does feel great.",4
"First of all, I want to say that these are EXTREMELY cool. I have never seen anything like this and for someone who will lay in bed to binge watch an entire series on Netflix, these are super nifty for avoiding any kinks in your neck. I actually thought it was a fluke because there is no way you could watch a show clearly with something like this, but IT IS LEGIT. The image is a bit smaller though.Cons:- Heavy -- considering these are to be worn like glasses, they are relatively heavy and can be super uncomfortable if worn for too long, so it's not ideal for long-term use.- Vision impairment? I am not sure how to explain it, but since you're technically staring at a reflection, it kind of messes with your eyes, in my opinion. I am not sure how it is when reading, but if you wear them while watching tv, then it almost feels like you're going cross eyed. Again, only happens if you wear them for too long. I've actually used them before bed if I couldn't fall asleep because it almost makes your eyes feel droopy and tired...Overall, it's super inventive and a really unique product, and despite the cons, I would still recommend it considering how inexpensive it is! But if you are prone to getting headaches, I wouldn't buy it.",4
Great buy for the price will buy again.,4
"These glasses are really pretty slick. De to the multi-focal lenses, I can wear them with or without my contacts, so I don't have to have different glasses (yes, my contacts do not completely fix my reading...)They don't sit quite right on the nose, so they do leave a mark when you wear them for any length of time. And they are NOT fashionable! They do, however, work great, and the price is very reasonable. Definitely recommend.",4
"For the price, these glasses are a steal. The materials feel high-quality and the craftsmanship is excellent!So far So good!",4
A good value but not very sturdy s little more fragile than expected. But great price so are more disposable,4
"The instructions specifically said not to walk around with them on, but the kids couldn't resist. They're a bit heavy on your nose but they did really help with neck fatigue while crocheting for long periods.",4
"This review is for: Virtegasas Horizontal Lazy Glasses Bed Prism Spectacles Lazy Readers Glasses Periscope Eyeglasses Upgraded Prism Glasses - For Reading and Watching TV in Bed While Lying FlatGot these yesterday. Pretty wild! They really do work. I have to say that it's pretty wild how your vision is separated through these two tunnels and your eyes still put the two images together, perfectly, like it's one image. Just a fun anatomy thing, I guess.I tried them two ways, close up and more of a distance. Laid flat in bed and looked at my phone. Vivid and crystal clear, just as if you were looking directly at your phone. While you can see a little but of something down the center of your vision in a way, it doesn't interfere with the object you're looking at and you can still see it clearly.Then, while still laying flat in bed, I tried watching TV. My TV is on a wall that is probably about 13 feet or so from my eyes. Still, the image was clear and I could see it perfectly.The only reason for 4 stars is that in both cases, the image is smaller and seems farther away than it is. I think this is just the physics involved with the image being reflected and there is probably no avoiding it. It's not too bad, but it is very obvious that the image you're looking at is smaller and farther away, seemingly. Maybe it's not fair to dock the product if this illusion is unavoidable, but 5 stars on these might convey that they reflect the image just as if it would be if you were looking at it directly, but it does not.Price is very reasonable at (currently) $13.99.I feel that these could be extremely useful in certain circumstances where mobility is an issue! If someone had neck troubles, etc., this would be a great solution.If I could give these 4.2 or 4.5, I would.I hope this was helpful.",4
"I love these and definitely recommend to anyone and everyone! Kind of heavy on the bridge of my nose and on my ears, but I'm not used to wearing glasses regularly so that is probably the cause.",4
"These bifocals stickers are good quality, rigid material, not flimsy and work great.......once you get them to adhere to your glasses. I ordered 2 sets and three of the stickers adhered fairly easily but the fourth one would not stay stuck. I had to reapply several times, which was easy to do, and the top edge of the sticker just will not stick. I finally decided it was as good as it was going to get and since I could still see thru the bifocal to read etc. I just quit trying to get it perfectly stuck. These are basically like putting a screen protector on your phone or tablet and have the same issues such as bubbles. There is also a definite right and wrong side to the sticker because they have a slight curve to them. If you have completely flat lenses on your glasses, not sure these would work. But once I got the stickers to adhere to my sunglasses they worked fine and I am happy with my purchase.",4
"They’re al little cheaply made, but perfect for what I wanted and the price. I use them all of the time. There are some blind spots and my glasses have fogged up, but I do recommend them!",4
"I bought these 2.5 diopter flip glasses for doing electronics work. I was tired of having to search my messy work area to find the other pair of glasses when I needed to change between reading my computer screen and being able to see what I was working on. That meant switching between some 1.5 glasses and and my 4.0. Since my search skills are horrible (I swear I can't find my own feet), this ate up a lot of time and patience.I love these! They are convenient and clear. They are easy to put on my drug store reading glasses. They work just like having two different pairs, without the searching pain.Yes, they are a little heavy. What would you expect. They don't have an anti-gravity mechanism to make them weightless. I had to tighten up the ear pieces on my 1.75's so the assembled pair wouldn't slide down my nose. But, they're not so heavy that they are uncomfortable.I need to get my wife her own pair for her beading work.",4
"I bought these lenses in January 2018. It is now August 2018 & I need to replace them. So I got about 7 months of HEAVY use for just under $13 -- not bad at all, but not quite great.The glasses are reasonably scratch resistant. Fairly light in weight so... comfortable to use. I flip them up & down a lot -- down for reading, up for conversations & other activities. The spring holding the lens when flipped up is still working just fine. However, the spring that holds the lens in place when it is flipped down, so as to be against my glasses for reading purposes -- that spring has lost some power. As a result, the lenses ""sag"" away from my glasses, just a quarter inch or so, when I tilt my head to read or do cloose work. It's a minor annoyance but spoils my concentration at times. So I just bought a replacent pair of lenses.The lenses themselves are great. Flip lenses are a good idea for people who, like me, make frequent shifts between close work & other activities. With lighter use these lenses would surely last longer. Even so... 7 months of heavy use for under $13 -- I can live with that.Aloha to all from Hawaii.",4
I do wear these all the time. I like that they have a pair of sunglasses too because I am always reading outside.I can use them only in my home for the 'one power' like looking up at the TV from my computer or book. It does not work when I'm driving at all.,4
"These are built pretty well. Not sure how they work. They do not seem to adjust from low to high, but I can wear them all day or just to read, and all is in focus. A mystery! Still a huge value here.",4
"These have lasted the longest Ive ever had a pair...going on 3 years hanging on my shirt collar every day. a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.",4
"The glasses fit great and work well for my intended purposes. The only problem I had was that the left temple was bent and almost broken. I was able to fix this without breaking the temple. The packaging was a ziploc bag inside an envelope, with no real protection against being crushed.",4
Fit well and and are as described. Non- Bi-focal readers that allow for ease of use.,4
"They look good, but the plastic lenses are definitely lower quality and blurrier than glass.",4
These glasses fit the description. They do have hinged eat pieces and open & close smoothly. They come with a pouch to keep them in. The only thing I don't like is the lack of packaging/shipping protection. They shipped like the picture above in a thin bag inside a standard Amazon envelope. If the glasses don't come with better protection I would have appreciated they be in a bubble wrap bag. Because of that I'm giving them 4/5 stars.,4
"The color and style are pretty. Because the glasses are big they are heavy. They are good quality for the money. They slip too far down my nose, so that is why I gave them 4 stars. Maybe my nose or face is too thin for the glasses not sure. For me the nose arch could be thinner to stay up higher on my nose and face. I’m going to try to get used to them, because the are pretty. Also they come with a small amount of accessories like a neck cord, and a lens wiping cloth.",4
They were just what I wanted. Ty,4
"While these were super cheap, I love them. I've looked for rimless, round readers forever. They are very light and I realize not particularly sturdy but for the price they are well worth it. I plan to order a couple more pair when the first pair inevitably breaks. I'm rough on glasses...",4
"These are REALLY Nice glasses, and I'm really pleased. They have a real professional/ executive look to them, which is what I was going for. The lenses are crystal-clear, with NO reflections whatsoever. Everything is very much in FOCUS! I just wish the arms were a bit more substantial.. because as they are, they are just thin wire-like arms. So I have to handle these with utmost care, because they seem very delicate. So I keep them in the case whenever I'm not using them (or in the shirt pocket). Otherwise, I do recommend these Nice glasses.",4
no side rims to block your vision area which is why i got them.,4
They work and come with extra batteries. They do make fine work easier but definitely mess with your vision if not focused on something near by.,4
"I like to work on crafts and my aging eyes make having reading glasses essential to being able to see close up. Adequate lighting is also important. The Lighted Reading Glasses seemed like the perfect combo. The glasses come with their own storage bags and cleaning cloths. The set also includes extra batteries which is a nice addition. Over all the glasses feel cheaply made. The frames are fairly flexible and feel like they would break without much effort. The lights however are bright and do light up the space right in front of them. The lights work independently from each other allowing the wearer to use either light alone or both together. The on/off switch is a little switch the sticks out on the underside of the arms and is moved back and forth from the on and off position. These will work nicely for up close crafting, but I don't think they will replace my usual cheap dollar store readers for every day use.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I decided to give these magnified readers a try to see if they might be a good option for reading or working on an art project in bed while my partner is sleeping and not wanting to disturb them.I didn't expect much but these exceeded my expectations. They are bright wherever I am looking but are not bright off to the side. A light on each side behind the hinge has a small switch to turn the light on and off. One light is more than sufficient for most tasks.The temples are a bit bulky, especially near the hinge they aren't something I notice in my field of vision or feel any noticeable weight difference when wearing. The frames feel like low-quality plastic so I don't expect them to hold up long term. The magnification works well and surprised me as I always find this to be the biggest issue with magnified readers. I don't find myself straining or sitting closer or further away than I do with my regular readers. Each pair comes with a nice drawstring eyeglass case, too. It's a decent set if you're looking for this type of feature.",4
"My first try with progressives. I got tired of the ""on and off"" of my glasses in class. So far these are wonderful! Wish I had tried them earlier. These particular frames are much better than I had expected. I was expecting fairly poor quality, but good enough to try at such a low price. If I had not liked them or if progressives did not work for me, I would not have felt badly about the cost. However, they are cute, don't slip off my face, and seem well-made. I will be buying another set! No need for more expensive frames, Recommend.Update: afterwards I realized I had ordered the wrong magnification. Exchange was very easy and now I have the correct magnification. Appreciated the great customer service!",4
These glasses work great for the computer and sewing. Much better than trying to make do with bifocals. While the distance vision is not clear mid and close up are perfect.,4
"I got these to save my neck while crocheting, and they are excellent. The only thing is the lenses are quite heavy, and the nose piece area isn’t very curved, so they don’t sit on my nose as comfortably as regular glasses and the weight puts pressure on my nose. I may get a different pair if I can find a lighter option, but otherwise I’ll be using these and taking breaks for my nose!",4
They work great! Such a relief on the neck when reading or crocheting for long periods of time. Slightly heavy but great value,4
They put the sticker on the arm and I cannot get it off.,4
The sunglasses were super cute. I loved them. I dropped them once on my kitchen floor and they broke past repair. Not the plastic but the cheap metal hinges.,4
"They look vintage, fit comfortably and are made well. Was disappointed that they did not come with an eyeglass holder. Not coming with a holder/ case just added an additional cost on my end. Most readers/ cheaters I have purchased on Amazon come with their cases/ sleeves. I was lucky the glasses arrived in one piece because they were shipped in a plastic bag inside an Amazon bag with nothing to protect them in the mail.",4
"Added these to that collection of reading specs you leave lying here and there in your workplace and home. With their tortoiseshell frames, these achieve the retro-professor look I wanted. Non-adjustable bridge still fits firmly further down my nose, for the imperious glower. Optical glass perhaps not the best: lenses are a bit loosely mounted, the reason for deducting one star.",4
"Good overall, a little heavy on the nose",4
"I liked the idea of this product because I like to read in bed, and the idea of not having to roll back and forth for comfort was appealing, as was the idea of not having to hold my phone above my head to see. Unfortunately, it makes me a bit motion sick to use it while reading, and the glasses are quite heavy, so laying on my side is awkward. It is great for watching TV shows while laying in bed though, for some reason the motion sickness doesn’t affect me with that. I liked the product though, and it’s a fun gimmick to mess with your family.",4
"I have received several compliments, but they really don’t get dark enough to call them really good sunglasses. They are very good glasses for reading.",4
"I had to have the 1st pair replaced...the frame mounts for the nose pieces was lose..a rivet kind of attachment and not a screw so there was no way to tighten. The replacement pair seems fine in that regard. My issues are not major but are perhaps more about how I need for them to work. The bifocal part is fine...but the clear portion of the lense above the bifocal is if anything distracting. Granted, at this price I don't expect perfect optical clarity but they just seem to not be in the right spot all the time. As for comfort, they seem to be a little tight on the back of my ears but I'm betting an adjustment will help with that. Again...this is probably more me and what I need for them to do. They are extremely light weight, seem to be made well, and for the bifocal part are great...",4
"Obviously prescription sunglasses would be best. Having said that, they do enable better near vision than nothing, when, like me, you don't really need glasses for daylight driving.",4
Seems cheaply made. Yet clarity is good. Serves the purpose as readers.,4
"I ordered a pair of SOLPRO Super Light Reading Glasses, but I'm a bit disappointed in the quality of the lenses.",4
"I really liked the low profile of these reading glasses. I needed them to put under my safety glasses at work, and I thought these might work out.Although I liked the design, they were not the right fit for my safety glasses, which have a more rounded contour over the eyes and forehead.I decided to keep them in my purse, for the off chances when I need to read a menu or sign something. However, when I last tried to use them, I pulled them out of my purse pocket to find them broken. They had snapped over the bridge of the nose.Oh well. (I ended up going out and finding some readers for work at a local budget store.)",4
"I bought this before the summer. Now, the summer is totally ended and winter even begins, I want to share some about this AC. I put this AC in my less than 200 ft^2 living room; however, when the sun really burns during noon on the hottest days, you can feel the coolness and only where it blows cool air. To be honest, if possible, I really want to return this item.",4
"Just received this unit.. big & heavy, but it sure does cool nicely! I am using it in a small bedroom and it can make the room chilly in a matter of minutes.CONS:- Air conditioning mode requires the fan running 24 hours a day. Doesn't matter if the A/C is only active 1 hour a day. You can't turn the fan off. I was hoping for something like a hotel air conditioning unit. Kicks in & makes noise while cooling (a small price to pay) but then remains silent the rest of the time. I realize this increases efficiency (circulating air in the room) but I wish it was an optional feature. If you want A/C, even in standby, expect to have the fan blowing all the time.- No Canadian warranty. The instructions say the warranty is only for the continental 48 United States.PROS:- Wow, this thing cools fast. I've tried it in single host (2nd hose optional) and 2-hose configurations, and it works fantastic.- Compressor is pretty darn quiet. I've owned my share of A/C units and can tell you that this is a refined product. Good quality. Someone totally new to A/C might not realize this, but compared to other options. this unit has decent sound control.- 2 hose unit. It is more efficient to use 2 hoses (prevents less warm air being sucked into the home, and therefore better cooling) but it's not required. If you just want one hose going outside, this unit will still work just fine.",4
"The product is great, so far. I have bought this same c unit and it ran for 3 yrs no problems. I havnt had this one long enough to know the longevity but it puts out good air flow.Thos is the 2nd order due to the first arrive very poorly packed and was broken, but that could have been UPS and not the company packing. No problems with shipping on the 2nd delivery. Thumbs up!!",4
"This item cools very well. However, the instructions report that the collars are attached upon delivery. They are not. I am a novice and I found it very hard to get both collars on. I had to use duct tape to get them to stay. The instructions also said that foam insulation was included. Not so. I used materials that I had at home to try to complete a tight fit, and duct tape of course.Other manufactures provide the insulated stripping so the fit is as tight as possible.I purchased Honeywell because it is an American product. I was disappointed that other manufactures made installation much more complete and easy. Thanks Rita",4
"This unit BLASTS cold air for a great distance. With the louvers set to “swing”—my whole living room gets cool very quickly. In fact—I had to turn it off a couple of times—and sit shivering under a blanket!I was also impressed at how quiet it is. I’ve only run it on the highest setting so far—and it’s right next to where I sit to watch TV. It doesn’t bother me at all.The remote control, and the WiFi connection to the app, were super easy to set up.The only problem (and it’s a BIG one) is the window installation kit. It only extends to 68.5 inches. My sliding glass door is 91 inches tall. Even using TWO complete sets of kits didn’t help. For one thing—all of the included panels don’t universally ‘mate’ to each other. As a result I had to use 2 panels with the opening for attaching the hose—and then mount another full panel behind the upper one, to cover the hole.The photo—taken after some of the upper panels came crashing down—shows how it buckles, and pulls the hose out of its panel, leaving enormous air gaps. Waiting for my favourite contractor to return from vacation to fix this mess!I ended up with a leaning tower of panels—with gaps you can put your fist through. Within a day—the various joints began to buckle—and the top 1/4 came crashing down.I think the window installation kit would work perfectly with the average hung or sliding window—making this unit an excellent choice.However, if you have to install in a sliding door—be prepared to construct a custom window kit, using wood.",4
"I have set up my airconditioner with the help of a friend. I was concerned that the item delivered was sent with the venting adapter for a hung window. That was a lot of plastic. And my window is a casement window. Fortunately a friend was able to use the adapter sent to me. Where I live, most apartments in any buildings built from the 1970s on tend to have casement rather than hung windows. It would be helpful to be able to opt out of receiving, and paying for, a vent adapter one can't use.I have given this a/c a test run. It is still too cool where I am to be using it for any length of time, so I can't give you an account of how satisfied I am with this purchase.",4
I bought this for a studio so the area is much smaller than what it's designed for but I have no seperate rooms to seal up. Bought it with the intention of keeping it for a few years when I'll hopefully move to a bigger place.Unit has definitely been getting louder as time passes and I honestly feel like the filter isn't going to be enough to keep it maintained long term. Will definitely need to be opened up and cleaned out after a year or two.Works super well though and relatively easy to set up.Be careful with the ventilation hose/pipe. Easy to split the corners of it when extending to the window but I'm planning on insulating it anyway so not a deal breaker for me.App won't work with it on 5ghz wifi so make sure you have dual band or 2.5ghz if that's a dealbreaker for you. Personally I'll be buying a new router as my Shaw one doesn't work with most smart devices.Definitely recommend the AC unit.,4
vents could be better designed. should be adjustable but i made a deflector to direct air upward.BUT it really gets cold.noise level isnt really loud about same as hotel room unit. BUT had intermittent vibration issues which is really annoying at night. turned out to be copper piping from compressor which i fixed by pushing a tube just a bit and isolating vibe with a large rubber o ring attached to another pipe to another part of the unit to keep it taught,4
"Okay...this is the first portable A/C unit I've owned. I held off purchasing one for quite a while as I couldn't figure out how to set one up with the window that I have (tall, swings out at bottom). But after finding a window seal that is set up for windows that swing out at the side, and adapting that, I was able to set up this A/C unit. I placed it in my bedroom (approx. 11x12) and have to say that the difference in temperature was almost immediate as soon as I turned it on. I live in a city that can get very hot and humid in the summertime (Ottawa, Canada...high temps can be upward of 40deg Celsius), and I have a dog who doesn't tolerate heat very well, so - after a failed attempt with a swamp cooler (does not work in high humidity areas) - decided to put my money on the De'longhi. And so far, no regrets.I love the remote that comes with this unit. I love that the air conditioner takes almost no time to cool down an 11x12 room. I love that it isn't that much of a space hog (a bit, but to be expected with portables). And I love that it has a noise dampening option. Personally, my hearing sucks. I wear hearing aids, and when I take them out at night to sleep, a bomb wouldn't wake me, so noise isn't an issue there. But in the evenings where I decide to run the A/C in my living room (vertical slider in that room, the window kit that comes with the A/C works perfectly in the window) the A/C needs to be quieter so I can hear the tv. On 'whisper' mode, it's perfect. Yes, the A/C still makes some noise, but not enough to interfere. I also love the fact that it doesn't require emptying of a water reservoir. Well, so far none....but even if it did need to be done once or twice during a summer season, thatThe only con that I have so far with this unit is that, while it is portable, it is very heavy and makes it rather difficult to move from room to room, esp. if thick carpeting is involved. However, this is such a minor annoyance that it's hardly worth mentioning.Time will tell if this A/C stands up to long-term use...so far I've used it 7 or 8 times - but for now, I'm really pleased, and really glad that I bought it.*Update: Within the first few months of using this A/C unit I noticed that it was very wobbly whenever I had to move it from one room to another, and it started to get lopsided. It took me a while to figure out, but finally did...one of the wheels was damaged and completely missing after moving it. To me this is a 'this shouldn't happen with ordinary use'; however, I have had the A/C for two years now, and despite this one 'shouldn't have happened' defect, the A/C itself is still working fine. (My workaround, I put a book under the defective side.)It's very rare that I need to actually remove water from it, and I live in a very high-humidity area (Ottawa, Canada). Compare this to a Costway A/C that I purchased earlier this year (so I would no longer need to move the A/C from room to room): the Costway unit was used 3 times, and on the third morning I woke up to the carpet in my bedroom absolutely, completely soaked with water (and my hardwood floors underneath probably damaged).I still back up the De'Longhi A/C in terms of functionality, and would recommend it.",4
"Works as an effective fan, but in order to get the most out of the cooler you need to use cold water. Like actually cold water. Ice would be useful too but the fill port is very small and will not fit standard sized ice cubes. I refrigerate a gallon of water and then use that to fill the unit. Even when not filling with water and just using the fan feature, this effectively blows air and does a decent job of cooling the room.I have been looking for an air cooler for some time and most are super cheap and un-trustworthy. This one works well, but it does come at a price.",4
"Note this is an air cooler, not an air conditioner. I bought this to put in a small, windowless bedroom where I can’t vent out a portable air conditioner. Works great to cool the room. Knocked off a star as I wish the water intake were a bit bigger so that it would be easier to fill without spilling everywhere and that I could put ice in it.",4
"This is alright, I bought this because I live in an apartment. I get dry heat in the winter no matter if I like it or not, and the humidity is less than 10% in my place. I bought this to help prevent me from opening windows when the outside Temperature is -20 F. In the summer with 60% humidity.. it doesn't cool.. just makes it more humid. This is not an air conditioner and wasn't intended to be. The basic features appear to work fine. I'll know more come winter",4
This air cooler does cool the air in the room. I used a fan also to circulate the cool air. It does need to be filled with water a couple of times a day and the back filter needs to be cleaned every couple of days.,4
"I purchase this to air condition our camper and the installation was simple. This unit is high quality build and quite. It runs really efficiently, and reaches set temperature quickly. I have not needed to use the dehumification mode yet, so can't comment on the installation of the drainage for that type of setup. I would have given it 5 stars; but the exhaust vent tube on the back side is quite large, and you need quite a bit of space behind the unit, and in a camper that could be a little lacking. However, if you placed this in a cabin or small room of home, it would be fine. I would highly recommend this AC Unit.",4
"We've been in a hot dry (translate: drought!) situation for over two months and I deemed an evaporative cooler to be best for the situation (my brother calls them ""swamp coolers""). I'm glad I chose Honeywell; they have a respected name to uphold and this product is no exception. It cools quite well, even when it's over 30 celsius, especially when I add ice to the top compartment.. And it offers a choice of useful settings. It's a little hard to fill; and I don't look forward to draining it when the season's done. Guess I'll let it run as dry as it can and get my younger, stronger brother to lift it into the the tub to drain. Those are the only reasons for the reduction from 5 stars.",4
"This works great, but it is LOUD. It also made my electric bill jump up quite a bit. I'm glad to have it, but I'll be limiting how much I use it.",4
"A bit noisy, but doable, and keeps my bedroom at a comfortable, consistent temperature. The window kit fits a window higher than 36"",my window is 39"" and the window insert extended just fine. Haven't had a power bill yet, so don't know about it's energy efficiency. I can care less about the remote!",4
"It met our expectation during the past Summer 2021 Heat Wave in British Columbia. Easily cooled off our 400 sq. ft. main bedroom. Furthermore, it also worked well in our 800 sq. ft. 2nd level room of our townhouse unit.The only flaw of this product is the window kit. It is short when putting it vertically and we still need to buy an extra window kit just to fill the window gap.The price is also a bit high that we paid as much as $1400. The price is doubled compared to other online stores like Wayfair.",4
"For starters, if you're looking for something to cool an entire room, this is NOT the purchase to make!! That being said though, this is perfect if you need something to set up near you while sitting at a desk or something local like that. The air isn't freezing by any means, but it's definitely cool air and feels nice. It's pretty energy efficient, easy to use, and the noise isn't bad! It can get a bit loud on the 4th (highest) setting, but it's not an annoying sound in my opinion. I do wish there was a line to show the max level the water can be because when I first got it I did make the mistake of overfilling it, so make sure you turn on the light to make it easy to see the water level as you're filling it up. Otherwise, I have no real complaints about it! As long as you're realistic in understanding that it's for cooling a localized area rather than an entire room (unless that room is very small,) it works great for what it's meant to do and I'd say is worth the purchase now that I'm entering my second summer of using it!",4
"Third try is the charm. All of these stupid ads about blast chill tech is just smoke and mirrors. All these things are just fans with mist ie Evaporitive Coolers. What you want is fan power and mist power and 90% of them are crap in both categories.This one delivers with great mist and great fan power. In addition it's water tank is much larger than most. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the fan blows upward and there isn't a way to direct the flow. So on a night stand it goes over your head. I put something under the back edge to solve the problem.This is the third one I tried and is the only one worth getting. The other little box ones, or the ones with special hexagon lattice inside, and the one which shows you a refrigerator coil which it doesn't actually have are garbage. They don't put out enough air flow or mist to do anything. Get this one!!",4
Air conditioner is pretty good but very expensive for the amount of room that It can cool down it works very well however it only works in a small space. It is a nightmare to install because the piece that goes in the window does not fit a normal window it is either too small or too big the part that you use to adjust it to the window only adjusts into a window over the normal size and if you take that adjustment piece off and then it is too small to fit in the window.,4
I'm realy pleased with this unit. It wasn't cheap but you get what you pay for. Its heavy and awkward to transport & unbox but super easy to set up with no assembly other than than the window exhaust installation. It worked well right from the first push of yhe on button. I haven't tried the phone e- connection so I can't comment on that. But it nicely cools my large living/dining/hall in 80-90F weather. I also like the fan only air filter option. Its a bit noisy on high fan but not annoyingly so. The remote is a nice extra.,4
"Yes it works great for a bedroom. Yes installation was a breeze. No it's not quiet at all.Good luck sleeping with this on, It's about as quiet as the food court at a mall on a Saturday. (Slight exaggeration but you get the point). Maybe its just because I like to sleep in silence.It would be nice if it would turn off the blower once the room temp has been reached but I have yet to have that happen. ""Night Mode"" just locks the settings. One thing to note, you may want to insulate the exhaust hose with a blanket (preferably wool for fire resistance) as the hose gets quite warm. The drain tank is not removable, it drains through a little valve at the bottom. They do include a silicone hose to drain the water which is nice.I ordered this one because my AC went out and this was cheap and had 2 day shipping. Not to mention my window is mostly blocked by a desk so this style works great.Overall not a terrible AC unit, just not for noise sensitive people.",4
"Good air flow, strong breeze, very cools with ice blocks. Well worth the money",4
Electric cord is to short.,4
Worked really well,4
"Update 11/6/2024Guess I've had my first failure after a year. The 3 speed switch or resistor no longer functions properly. No low or medium speed, but high still works at least.Know what you're getting with an evaporative cooling fan.It's not an air conditioning unit and there's only so much it can do, especially in an already humid environment.I do like the fan, there's other similar fans on the market for lower cost, but this one is green and it matches my toolboxes lol.This is packaged very poorly with only a thin cardboard box and it came a bit beaten up from shipping.Nothing major though, just some dings in the plastic, still works fine and does not leak.I'm a heavy equipment mechanic in East Texas, so there's an absurd amount of dust in our shop, extreme heat, and high humidity majority of the time.It does cool down the temperature a few degrees on the drier days, others it just makes everything feel more wet.I've only had it for a few months so far, but it's holding up well despite the dusty environment.Strong fan for the size, it will blow itself backwards unless the wheels are locked or it has water inside.",4
Hoping they both work after the looong winters here.,4
"Like the fact it does cool the living room down. It I'd definitely not quiet. It's loud. Iis a bit of idiosyncratic which means you'll be emptying the two tiny (and I mean tiny) water traps a couple of times a day and they are placed in a way that makes no sense making it annoying as heck but it does have a good fan on it. And does cool pretty good. I would suggest 3 placed about a 3br ranch style home to stay pleasantly cool all thru the home. Maybe buy some plastic tubing for continuous draining to empty into a flat, lipped container to empty at your convenience. Drains about a cup total, a day",4
"I haven't used the unit much, but it seems to work fine and was easy to set up. It cools nicely and I am happy with my purchase.",4
"The media could not be loaded. Pros: Arrived quick and packaged well. Very easy set up, though I suppose that depends on your window. It def heats your space up, and fairly quickly- which is excellent. It is a reasonable volume for what it’s doing. Used for AC for a short period, same- it cooled space well. Looks decent and exactly as pictured.Cons: the biggest negative is how the heat setting produces TONS of water in the machine that requires draining, and the drain hole is at the very bottom. A hose is provided that is useless, because you cannot create a suction, and therefore you cannot use a bucket. So, unless you elevate your machine on blocks, you only have about a half inch to work with. Ironically the water space in the machine must go below the drainage hole because you have to pick up and slightly tilt the machine to FULLY empty it. I used an old baking tray to allow continuous drainage, which looks terrible, but if the height is above the hole, then it will not drain and the machine will shut off. Like literally, if the water catching bin is the slightest bit higher than the hole the hose isn’t working, lol. The amount of water does decrease some as the machine runs, but not enough to ignore the design flaw.There is also some leakage from the exhaust tube. With AC the exhaust is hot air. With Heat running the exhaust is cold air. I recommend taping the connection points where exhaust is to reduce air escape/blow back.Unknown: I can’t comment on the price but I am certain it will be less than my electric baseboard several decades old. Saving $$ is also why I got this machine and getting it on sale def seems worth it if my monthly bill goes down significantly. The house is loads warmer too.4 stars because it works as described and looks decent. 1 star off because of the drainage being a big PITA.",4
"By ""med - large room"" I mean the difference between a reg bedroom or a living room/dining area together. I filled the tank, set it on 3 (out of 4) and the entire living room/dining area was cooled off withing 1-2 hours and I live on the sunny side of a building. It gets really hot here. I then turned it down to a 2 and that's where it 's been for a week. The ice packs didn't do much. They take up room for needed water. I put 2 - 64oz bottles of water in the fridge and pour one in the tank when it gets below half a tank. You can easily see the water level on the front. If it cools off at night, you can turn off the water pump to save water but it still evaporates over time. I like the moist air at night for my sinuses.It's not silent but it's pretty quiet. A definite positive.I really like this fan but here's 1-2 bad things.The display on top turns off (lights go off) so at night I can't see what settings it's on until you press buttons on the remote or the fan itself. If it had a motion sensor on top to light up when it detects your hand, that would be great.As stated, the ice packs didn't make much difference if you're putting cold water in there regularly. They took room away for more water.Only one issue from a handicapped/wheelchair POV: The release for the tank on the back is all the way at the bottom near the base. It's hard for me to bend that low to open the back tank but it opens easily and closes/secures easily. It's also an issue for me to see the top of the fan controls easily. For someone standing over it, it's perfect. For someone who's eyes are basically level with the top, it's a little difficult but not too bad. Just a LITTLE annoying.I still recommend it. It's the best fan I've bought in years and is pretty quiet.",4
"Bought this to keep me comfortable on the front porch during the Florida summers while I make Internet's and smoke cigars; it worked almost as well as I hoped.The bad: I wish it got a bit cooler. It does a nice job and for the most part does what I hoped. There were a couple days that a few degrees cooler would have made the difference but it still.did a great job as I would have been too uncomfortable to sit out for a few hours.The good: it blows a large amount of cool, dry, air that is very directional - a foot in either direction and you will loose the bubble of comfort. The condensation reservoir is substantial and generally will allow me to run it for 3 or so hours - in Florida humidity - before needing to be emptied. The wheels make it easy to move around; it is a bit heavy to lift but not unmanageable. I often make phone calls and conference calls while on patio and the unit is not so noisy to be noticeable or hamper patio conversion.If you are looking to solve a similar problem, this unit works very well.",4
The media could not be loaded. It's EXPENSIVE for what it is. No reason this should be over $500 (probably $300-$400) so at $744 it's high.I'm planning on using it camping. I'm sure it will work great for night time cooling. It's heavy but sort of compact. It's ok to leave in the rain they say so to me that's important for my use scenario. I'll be running it outside my tent and simply piping the cool are outlet hose it.I'm going to add an extension hose to the outlet and possibly the drain. I'll update my review when I have finished those projects.,4
"I bought this this help my outdoor dog through the scorching summers in the west. It absolutely works, and is quiet as a mouse. It puts out hot air from the exhaust side, so I don’t know how it would be in a garage, but it really only cools the spot in front of the duct anyway. 111 degrees yesterday, and my dog was cool as a cucumber in the shade with nice cool air blowing on him.",4
It is a good product.,4
"I have the cooler located in a well covered and shaded outside area for my outside pets here in the Southwest. Had to replace cooler pump at two months (June - July) of daily 14 hour use. If used a lot, or use is of any importance, I recommend keeping a new spare cooler pump on hand. Shopping around will show that replacement cooler pumps are readily available, ranging from $18 to $43. Cooler pump replacement is fairly easy with videos available online. I will have this cooler going 14 hours a day thru August, possibly September.The overall size is convenient and will fit just about anywhere. For me, supplying water via the hose attachment is an absolute necessity, but the float valve only allows the water level to rise just high enough to completely cover the cooler pump, about 1/4 of the tanks capacity. The existing float is fixed, but adjustable floats are available from Hessaire.I am disappointed in the plastic used for the housing as it seems to be brittle, so I am very careful with it. I never pick the cooler up by the provided handle if there is water in the cooler as I am not convinced the housing could take it.For the money, I think it does a pretty good job. I think I might have been happier paying a little more for a more durable, higher end, higher output model, since it is only used in extreme outside conditions (108F to 118F).",4
"I took a lot of this review from other Amazonian because I agree with all of it and it is worth repeating.""I did a ton of research trying to figure out if I even wanted a portable AC. I needed it for a room with west facing windows that gets blasted with direct sunlight the entire afternoon/early evening. Window units became very inefficient during really hot days and thought a portable solution would help. And it definitely has! But.... you need to know certain things in order to get the most out of this.Firstly, any review that mentions you don't need to worry about attaching a hose to drain excess water that builds up is 100% wrong. You MUST attach a hose for this for it to work properly. It'll turn on and work fine for short period of time until the water reservoir inside this fills up and causes it to shut off. If you're on the east coast with humid summers, this will fill up with water and will need to drain out in roughly 10-15 minutes after turning it on. I got lucky and just happened to have a hose from an old kitchen sink sprayer. It fit in there perfectly. The small holes on the plastic attachment that the exhaust hose attaches to that goes in your window can easily be widened using a scissor and slowly spinning/burrowing it to grind the hole big enough for the hose. Got my drainage hose through that hole and under the screen of my window to drain outside. Works perfectly.Secondly, the exhaust hose leaks out a bunch of heat from the hot air if fully expanded. If your plan is to get one of these and the exhaust hose just barely reaches the window there will be a noticeable amount of heat given off. The closer to the window the better and if you can find a safe way to prop it up off the ground so it's closer to the height of the window, I highly recommend that and it'll also make it easier to run the drain hose outside. I have mine setup to where the exhaust hose is barely expanded, which makes it thicker and allows less heat to escape, where the AC unit is roughly 15-20 inches from the window. I have these old wooden speaker stands I made that can easily support this AC unit and keeps it about 2 feet off the ground so the exhaust attachment on the back of the unit is even with the plastic attachment for the window. Ideally you want as straight of a line to the outside as possible for that hot exhaust air. And once you have the plastic attachment for the window installed, you'll wanna seal up any open cracks in between with tape.Last thing is using the Dehumidifier mode over regular AC mode. Mine didn't come with a manual so not sure if they both do the same thing but I always leave mine in Dehumidifier mode and works great that way. It blows out the same cold air and sucks all the moisture out of the air. Which if you live on the east coast, TRUST ME... You definitely want that. It's 94 degrees and miserable out today in Philadelphia and I'm perfectly comfortable. Look outside the window and the hose is just a continuous, fast drip. All that humidity ends up outside and makes it easier to keep the room comfortable. When I switch it to regular AC mode it doesn't seem as comfortable even though it blows out the same cold air. Not sure if it's just where I live and this room being on a 2nd floor but this works well for me in dehumidifier mode.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and this unit works well. It's a bit more noisy than I had hoped but all portable units are noisier than window units. It only makes sense when the whole thing being inside your room vs. most of it outside your window where sound will disperse away from your house. I see a lot of comments about how loud portable units are when these people don't seem to realize they're all like that. Even fancy, more expensive units will still be rather noisy. It's just how loud the fan is. So, beware of reviews by people who have limited knowledge on this sort of thing and just post their own narrowminded review of something like a portable AC unit, not understanding how it really works and what needs to happen to get the most out of one.",4
"I like the cooling of the Apex 700. It's also much quieter than my old evaporative cooler. I also like the fact that the intake and cooling vent are both on the front - which means it can be put in a corner without worrying about airflow. The hose intake is also on the back of the unit and out of the way.The unit is WiFi/app controllable, and can send status notifications to your phone. It was giving me some erroneous complaints about potential for overfilling for a few days, but those have gone away.The issue I've had with it - and almost sent it back over - is that it was leaking a significant amount of water. When I diagnosed the problem, I found that the cover for the evaporative media touches the media. When water gets to the front of the media, it wicks on over to that cover, then the path of least resistance for that water is to channel out of the unit and down onto the ground (or in my case, my patio's concrete slab).I don't know why the designers thought it was a good idea to have that front cover touch the cooling media that can have water on it, and not provide a path of least resistance for the water to wick back down into the unit rather than out onto the ground.Removing the cover over the evaporative media fixes the problem, but I think it would also work to space the cover out so it doesn't touch the media, cut the cover back, or add some kind of lip that extends down from the bottom of the grille that would wick the water down that way and back into the reservoir rather than out and onto the ground.",4
"Overall thank God for portable air conditioner. I live on the top floor and gets very hot in the summer. To make matters worse the bedroom window gets direct west facing sun all day. The portable air conditioner is BEAUTIFUL. The size, works well to move around and draws all the heat out in a matter of minutes, 9.5/10. Noise level is a little loud at first until you get use to it.",4
I will recommend this to anyone,4
effective,4
"Tired of super high prices for electricity these days and I live in South Louisiana where costs are pretty cheap. I wanted a stand alone AC unit for my bedroom so I don't have run the central AC for just me at night. Researched a bunch of these units and though I was skeptical of the price of this one, I took a chance. Here is my review:The GOOD: Very much like the standalone component of this AC unit. I wanted something portable that I could move around the house if the power goes out. This unit has WiFi and Alexa integration. About the only thing I have found useful about that is being able to turn it on and off with the Alexa. Outside of that, have not found any use for that integration. The unit cools very well for my bedroom which is a few hundred sq/ft. and the ambient noise is about the same as being in a hotel room and running the AC in always on mode. For me, not a problem. Additionally, I haven't really had to drain the internal condensate bucket and I run it every night. My room does not usually get more than 50% humidity so it does not produce a bunch of condensate. Even in the RV, didn't drain more than about couple of mL of water. The customer service was very good for the product too, when I needed it for the issue mentioned below.The NOT AS GOOD (but not terrible)1. Though the unit cools well for my bedroom, when I used it in a 31ft RV, along with the onboard AC in the RV, between the two of them they could only get the temp down to about 75* on a 95* day. At night it worked splendidly.2. The Alexa integration appears to be very limited. Other than turning on and off, I have not found any other useful features. Maybe I need to research further.3. After about 2 weeks of running all night every night, a new phenomenon cropped up. Once the unit gets the room down to set temperature, the compressor would cycle off as you would expect. The fan would stay running and then compressor would cycle back on as needed. Well after 2 weeks, I was awoken in the middle of the night by the silence, that you would expect when the power goes out. The unit went completely silent like it was turned off, but it was still on. Adjusting temperature kicked the unit back on and then randomly it would go silent again. After dealing with customer support for about a week and a half, it was determined that the unit is functioning as intended. The unit will turn the fans off if the room temp stays at the set level long enough. This may be ok for some but I like the ambient noise of the fans running. The issue is, you cannot set it to have a persistent fan unless you put it in ""Fan Only"" mode. I hope this is a feature that the manufacturer ends up programming into the unit. The ability to have persistent fan in AC mode.4. The expandable exhaust hose is versatile for moving the unit around but it does not contain the heat of the exhaust very well. The exhaust hose gets pretty warm and that ends up adding some heat around the unit. Its not a tremendous amount but I would expect an AC unit to contain the heat from the condenser a little better.Overall I am very happy with the unit for what I needed it for and the price. I would have thought a 10,000BTU unit would cool a little more efficiently but its fine. Also, I REALLY hope they put a persistent fan setting in the AC mode to keep the ambient noise and circulation of air going all night.",4
"This is my second Whynter Portable A/C unit. I find the brand comes highly recommended and my first unit has served me well in my living room for several years. I purchased the Whynter ARC-148MS 14,000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner for my home office after our record-setting heat wave in June. My home office is only 120 square feet and, by rights, I should be using a window-mounted unit, but I did not feel comfortable installing a window unit by myself in a second-story window, so I went with a portable unit. With that caveat, here are my impressions.COOLING. This Whynter works very well cooling my small space. It has a ""swing"" feature which raises and lowers the vent cover to provide an oscillating effect, which is nice.NOISE. Portable air conditioners are noisy, doesn't matter the brand or model. You are in the room with the unit, unlike a window-mounted unit where the noisy parts are outside. Because the room I am using this unit in is so small, only 120 sq ft., the noise is inescapable. If you want a quiet air conditioner, get a window-mounted unit. Running it on fan mode is a little quieter than in cooling mode, but I still feel the need to turn it off when I am on a call or online meeting.SETTING UP. Setting up the Whynter was very easy. This is a SINGLE-HOSE unit, which makes set-up a bit easier than a dual-hose unit. For performance, I actually prefer a dual-hose unit. The Whynter has casters so you can easily move it when needed. Follow the instructions, leaving your unit off for several hours after you first install it to assure best performance.PRICE. Portable A/C units tend to be more expensive than window A/C units. Given that I was unable to work in my home office this summer without A/C, the cost was worth it to me.OVERALL. I am pleased with this Whynter A/C unit. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the noise, but really, that is going to be an issue with any portable air conditioner. Whynter is my ""go-to"" brand for portable air conditioners.",4
It seems like when I put ice inside the tray it just doesn’t throw enough cold air it doesn’t matter how much ice i put in it.,4
"The media could not be loaded. I have older windows which window units wouldn’t work in. I found this floor unit and compared to other brands it was significantly less. I was apprehensive since I’ve never heard of Shinco. This little unit is great, definitely gets my room cold. I would give it 5 stars but it’s a bit noisy (can’t hear my tv since I have the unit right by my head, stupid window placement.) It’s worth the money for sure. I couldn’t use the plastic piece that the hose fits into on my window because it was too big, as a temporary fix I just popped it through the window screen and crack open my window when I use it.",4
"Now that I've had time to try different things with it I'm pretty happy with how well it cools. The instruction book left a lot to trial and error. Remote came with a battery but did not work so I can't evaluate that. The so called ""upper tank"" appears to be a way to fill the actual lower tank. No word in the instructions about the drain plug being left open or closed in the ""upper tank"" it appeared that to fill the lower tank you pull the plug and pour the water in the top then reinsert the plug for operation. Instructions say ""ice box"" can be removed from the unit and be put in freezer. I'm guessing this means one of the blue bottles that comes with it can be frozen and put in the top to aid in cooling. The instructions say doors and windows must be left open to operate. Pretty sure that would defeat the chance of cooling my house when it's 106 degrees outside. The louvers must be pried open with a fingernail or ? and positioned. After a lot of guessing I'm pretty pleased with it now.",4
"I have a West facing study room that the sun beats down strongly every afternoon during the summer months which the central air con cannot cope. The ideal solution should be a portable air con but condominium rules forbid the replacement of the window frames nor the sticking out of the exhaust chute from such a unit. This cooler is the next best choice. Whilst not as effective as an air conditioner, I measure the temperature dropping about 5°C when unit is running.However, it requires daily maintenance like emptying and filling of the water tank and the replacement of the ice packs every 3 hours. And these should be the bigger ones used in food coolers and not the toy like tubes that comes with it. If you are lazy and does not want to spend extra on some ""real"" cooler packs, this may not be for you.",4
"I purchased two costway coolers. I use them in a 20 by 20 room. It keep the room at least 10 degrees cooler than the rest of the house. I ran them most day on 80 to 90 days how ever those days over 90 you could really feel the moisture/humidity that these machines put out.Also there were a few review where people said they had odor off of their units. Since I had two I pulled one out and let it acclimate for a week or two before use, No odor at all. The second one I pulled out and let it sit for a few hours it had a small faint odor that was present first use but than was gone. We will see how it goes next season when I pull these back out. I suspect that the bad oder are from rancid water not able to escape the machine. I can't say yet.",4
It doesn’t stay on longer than 2 minutes. Poor quality.Update: the company has reached out to me to help resolve the problem. Ended up getting a refund. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly they responded and willing to help find a solution. They offered to replace but I declined since I no longer needed the item. I would definitely give the company another chance in the future. Product was a 1 star for me but because they tried to make it right I rate it 4 stars,4
"Cools very well with awesome air flow! You can feel it from up to 25 feet away when on high. Worked great here in the central valley of California up till the temps go over 102°, then efficiency drops considerably. But it's an evaporative cooler and they all do at those temps. This unit is very light and easy to move around on hard dirt if empty of water, and if full of water on concrete. It is not loud if on low, but on high you have to raise your voice if you are within 10 feet of it. My only real gripe is the motor rusted after only one cooling season and now is locked up after only 2 cooling seasons. If the additional 4 year warranty covers the motor then it would be well worth the extra money because the replacement motor costs more than the warranty does. Did not expect this to rust so fast being a motor supposedly designed for a damp environment, I expected the metal to be more rust resistant and was surprised that it was an open housing motor (you can see the windings) and not sealed. It is obviously not a motor designed for wet / damp environment. My other recommendation is to take a drill bit the same size as the original holes where the water drips from the top channel onto the pads and redrill / ream them out then blow out with compressed air. The manufacturing process of drilling out these holes seems to leave lots of plastic remnants which slow down or block entirely the steady stream of water. Removal of the top cover during this process will ensure that all plastic shavings are removed and can not continue to clog the holes. Other than that, it worked great, while it worked. Overall, I think it is overpriced for the quality. One could purchase a residential side draft swamp cooler for 800 dollars and with a few modifications (garden hose connection for water fill valve, caster wheels), would have a better quality product that's going to last much longer, albeit much heavier and not as portable!",4
"Update 2; received a replacement unit and this one is working fine. I suspect the original unit was damaged during shipping. The new unit is quieter than the original and the noise level now is ok; louder than a fan of course but it's not so loud you can't sleep with it on. Overall works fine now. When buying one of these I would suggest you make sure to test it out right away and run it a few times to make sure it wasn't damaged during shipping.Update: after speaking with the seller the offered to send a replacement. Will update this after I receive the new unitAbsolute piece of junk junk. Only actually ran for somewhere around 12-15 hours,. The cooling output was alright, but the noise level was absurd. And then things got bad. At this point it started making an extremely loud whistling sound - picture the most annoying teapot imaginable. This was multiple times louder than than just the standard running noise, which was too loud to begin with. Even after turning it off the whistling continued for another 30 to 45 minutes and could be heard two rooms away. After that the compressor stopped working, which mean no more cooling. So now it's a $300 fan, and not even a good one at that. Don't waste your time or money on this.",4
"So 3 months into owning this unit it’s finally hot enough outside to set it up. IT WORKS! Good thing since I’m out of my return window.Background: Moved into my first home with Central Air, works great downstairs, not so good upstairs. We lack a return up here, it is a retrofit gravity system. I needed a solution to not melt myself and my wife in a relatively small room with 2 robust gaming PCs and too many monitors.Pros:Air out the top is nice and coldRemote is easy to useSetup was about 10 minutesFan blows strong and the cooling vent has a nice oscillationCons:Pretty darn loud (All portable AC’s are since the compressor is inside the room)Exhaust tube is Very Hot, which is to be expected if you have any idea how an ac works.After about 30 minutes the computer room (upstairs, old house, 11x15’, newer windows) is still pretty warm, but it is getting better.(1 hr- still not Cold, yet better. Although there is no gaming going on so that will be the true test. I will update if this LG fails that test)Hindsight being 20/20, just shoving a window ac in would have definitely cooled the space faster and not introduced extra heat into the room (exhaust tube), while also being a bit quieter.BUT - Being relatively portable and not having to screw anything into my window/frame is very convenient. I can see myself keeping this unit and not giving it away like I have 7-8 window ac units before. Also hindsight, should have kept one…Tip: Keep the vent as short and straight as possible.Unit has a dehumidifier mode, you Must attach a hose to the upper drain.No hose/drain required dying AC mode, the unit has an evap system. It will however warn you if you need to drain it.I’d call it a safe buy, reputable brand, fair price per BTU. I think I’ll get some kind of insulation for the vent.",4
The media could not be loaded. It work well nice design but very expensive I found the same thing in the store for the third of the price around $550 they sold it to me on Amazon at $1500 so I would tell you to shop around go to different stores it’s much cheaper screwed big time,4
"Great product, received on time as promised. Cool down my 100 sq. ft office quickly, still testing out in my 1st month of operation. However, one down side...noice level is loud despite rating @51 db for quietness.",4
"It is easy to install, it works, but still a bit too noisy for my liking. But for a portable AC, I guess it is as good as it gets. The price point is expensive.",4
The unit works great after the first week... the only downside so far is the REPEATED CLICKING sound when in heat mode... the unit will click Loudly (like an electrical circuit switching on and off) as many as 5 times... this action repeats several times (at least 10) over the course of a night... it is loud enough to wake you up from over 20 feet away... Note: The cause of the clicking is explained in the user manual... The unit does heat and cool well... and does not click in cool mode.,4
"It’s does exactly what it says. Not too bad for heating. For cooling, it cycles cool water to expel a cool air flow from vent. BUT don’t expect to get cool like a HVAC can if your need to cool a space (semi insulated) during a heatwave. What I find that works for me is using gallon of water from fridge to pour into bucket and cycle several ice bricks (2 at a time) every couple of hours to get small space to a consistent, tolerable temperature if you’re gonna be in the space for several hours.",4
"I bought this unit because of it’s ability to add ice packs.The hose connector was missing a piece to connect to a garden hose. However, this company stands by their product because they immediately let me know that my order must have been missing this piece and immediately shipped it to me.Despite this, the swamp cooler works great, and it gets a two thumbs up from my wife, who prior to the arrival of the cooler, refused to sit on the patio when temps went into the 90’s. Operating on high, (which is very very quiet) temperatures in the low 90’s (93 to be exact) dropped to a very comfortable 84 in Central Texas Hill Country heat. The oscillating fan cools the entire 22’ x15’ patio, and evenings outdoors are now quite enjoyable. The ice packs add to the cooling effect. Definitely would buy this one again.",4
It works great. We have a tiny house it's 250sf and it does the job keeps it cool. But we only use it in the afternoon when we are home. We use a window AC during the day. It blows out hard cold air in the afternoon Florida heat at the right time,4
Bought this unit before any reviews were posted so obviously took a chance. Luckily it worked out for me as it is blowing cold air nicely. Knocked off 1 star as the window kit was not long enough to cover the height of my window (though I knew this from the product description). I had to buy a separate window kit.,4
"The first unit I got was defective, so I returned and got this one.On ""Strong"" mode, it's full fans and cooling. In a hot room, you need to be in front of the unit to feel the cool air. It's a good spot cooler, and that's about it.I may buy another one of these for power outages, short camping trips. But mainly, it's used at home for spot cooling in a hot room.I let it run for a few hours on full blast. It burned a stead 193 watts. Not bad for emergency/spot cooling. Just know what to expect. Not a strong fan, so you have to be close. It's only half the cooling capacity of the smallest window units.In a computer room, it's great when the PC starts heating up.Try it out! Expensive though.",4
I have been looking for some time and tried the available units in store. This unit is the best I found having consideration for price and efficiency. That is to say it is affordable and does make a difference. I live in QLD Australia and the humidity is a real problem. An 'evaporative cooler' is not an effective air cooler in humid conditions. This unit is an 'Air Conditioner' and does cool the air and remove humidity. I was impressed with the amount of water it removed from the air. I use it in a slide on (truck) camper. A small space and it works. This thing is not small but is comparable with the other units on the market and is lighter which is an important consideration weight is critical. this is the pick of the market at this price.,4
"My only dislike is the exhaust system. The hose fitting is loose on the section it attaches to the back of the air conditioner. Moving the air conditioner will sometimes make it come un-attached. I mainly use the cold air so the heat it produces needs to go out of the window. The exhaust hose adjusts in length but the insulated cover that wraps around the hose is not long enough for the hose. Since the exhaust hose is exposed and very warm, some of the heat is introduced back into the room I want to cool. Wish more exhaust insulation covers were available. Maybe smaller section covers included as an extention if needed.Instructions showed it can fit a smaller window such as a 20 inch but you have to cut the window adapter to the correct size. When the two pieces of window adapter plates overlap the exhaust port hole is covered. I had to cut out the section that covers the exhaust port hole.Other than that the machine sets as cold at 64 degrees Fahrenheit, quiet, and blows fairly strong. Would buy again if I must.",4
I like that you never have to dump the water all you have to do is refill it put ice or you can use cold packs to keep the water cool very easy to use,4
"It works, just not like we hoped. Our mistake for not researching!",4
"I bought this for our tiny desert vacation home. It is a basic evaporative cooler that cools hot air by having it flow through pads that are wet with water. I fill it only with water purchased from the store because of the large calcium deposits present in the well-water in the area. It has made our small, two-room cottage very bearable, even during the hottest afternoon. It is not ""refrigerated"" like an air conditioner, but it has an area to introduce ice if you want even cooler air. The most important thing is that it's on wheels, so we can push it to wherever we need to use it. While preparing meals, we can put it in the kitchen. During the rest of the time, we keep it in the living area. Beware, however, as evaporative coolers do not work in wet climates. Only buy if you live in an area with very low humidity or it will not work.",4
This air conditioner is good for small spaces,4
"Bought 2 of these units. The worst part was putting the casters on. They did not go on easily, needed a mallet and screwdriver to slowly nudge them in. Instructions are inadequate. Had an issue with my cooler at less than a year old where the remote wasn't working properly on one, and worked perfectly on the other unit. Also, the pump was not evenly pumping water down the sides, only down the back. And I did use a de-scaler made for coolers periodically throughout its use. I also used filtered water.Contacted customer service, they were very responsive, and after some troubleshooting, they sent me a new cooler. They sent me a return label to send the old one back.This unit does the job and cools down my 15 x 25 foot studio space in 10 minutes on very hot days. I live in a hot, very dry climate. When not using the cool/water feature, the fan alove provides very nice air circulation, and I like that you can regulate the vents for the air to go where you want it.",4
This air conditioner appears to be well made. My issue was the Vent hose was not long enough and the window guard that fits exhaust peice was too long to fit the window. Allow space around unit when measuring to fit in the room you choose.,4
"For the price paid, it is a good device. Easy to start. Additional accessories are also easy to install (with user manual included). So far for a few days of very hot weather, it has been good at cooling two rooms in the house. It is over a longer period of use that we will see the quality of manufacture of this model. But so far we are satisfied. :-)I make some additions of info on this machine:It works with us from a 120 volt alternating current. I don't know if it would work well on the battery in a caravan vehicle. Additionally, this system is 28 inches tall by 12 wide; so it takes up space. For noise, it is acceptable if it is placed far enough away from where you sleep (we can compare it to the sound of a refrigerator).",4
"Plus, as the air cools i barley see condensation forms and drips into drainpipe !",4
"Like the features, happy with the venting. Most important they cool not just 1 room but that wing of the house.",4
"This review is about the VCJ Portable Evaporative Air Cooler, which i bought for our patio. I was looking for something for our back porch, to keep us cool during the summer. and we came across this Air-cooler. The Unit is about 41' or 42 in height, connects thru an AC power cord. (no batteries required.) Also included are 6 ice pks, to keep the water cool. (But you can also add ice) The water tank is at the bottom, water is pored into it from the top tray. which then goes down into the tank. the water tank fills up about 3-4 jugs. (which last a long time.) i believe 3 or 4 days, maybe longer. The unit has 4 wheels, easy for pushing or pulling, to place right where you want it. The front vents are moveable up or down. to get the cool air on that perfect spot. it blows enough air, (about 8 or 9 feet away.) Honesty the coldness is not gonna beat a real home A/C. I would say that while it does a good job at blowing a lot of air. the coldness is about a 6 or 7 out of 10. which means that you can feel it. So NO! it wont leave you sweating. or hot. It also comes with button that moves the air left and right (which i didnt even know when i bought it.) lol The Unit has a nob for power on and off, as well as how high you want it..Low mid or high. numbred as 1, 2, 3. Personally i liked it. my family likes it. even my dog loves the freash air., lol I would buy again for me or as a gift. If you are looking for a budget air cooling A/C for either indoors or out. give this1 a try.",4
"The fan is very strong, even on speed 1, cools down very quickly. It is rather noisy, especially if you have the louvers moving side to side. Definitely don’t want to move it around much with it full of water. I didn’t see how to clean dust/dog hair from the vents, but I’m assuming it should be done after the unit has not been running for an extended period of time so it would have time to dry and could be vacuumed? Over all, we are pleased with this unit so far. 😊 October 2023 The performance of this unit was good. It helped a lot on really hot summer days. We finally figured out how to access the filters, by disassembling most of the unit. The dog hair and dirt did not vacuum off and I was prepared to buy new filters. Replacement filters were nowhere to be found on Amazon or any of the local hardware stores. I was able to get a hold of the company through the Amazon message board just to find out that this unit and it’s filters are no longer available. They did offer a suggestion for cleaning, which worked pretty well, but doubt they will last more than one more summer. My advice is to find out whether or not replacement filters are available before you purchase a unit.",4
Cools my living room just fine for the cost of the unit I am happy with the purchase.It is no louder than any other portable unit I have had in the past.Glad I bought it!!!!!!,4
Product performed as described.,4
Just the right size and power level for my needs. It goes through about 4 gallons of water a day for me so far. But I can’t give it a perfect 5 because the writing on the controls is rubbing off already.,4
"This might work for a tiny room, or to have as a fan while working In front of it. But it does not replace AC. I ended up getting a window AC Unit. It is nice to use as a fan for my baby while he plays during the hot days. I add the ice boxes often but have found putting ice in the top worked better at cooling the water. It’s not a bad product but definitely would not get this as an AC option if you have very hot summers.",4
"What these swamp coolers really need is a function that keeps the water cool because as soon as the water warms up, this becomes pretty useless. It works fantastic when the water is cold, but you'll likely run into the same problem I was in warm weather where the water gets too warm over time, even with the ice packs, and it begins to not work as well for cooling. What I suggest is this: if you will be using it for a long time like all day, don't fill the tank all the way. Fill it half-way and then fill it again later on with cold water and a new cold ice pack. That way, you aren't working with warm water the second half of the day.That issue aside, this does work very well with cold water. It almost feels air-conditioner-cold at first. It has a powerful air flow, too. I do like it a lot, I just wish it had a feature that keeps water cool!EDIT: A few days later, and both my ice packs split in the freezer, just like everyone else's. Sort of ridiculous that they include such horrible ice packs with this machine. I ordered six of these ice packs in Mini size (three of them fit in the top reservoir perfectly so I got three extras to keep cool while the first three are in use so I can rotate them): Igloo Performance Ice Blocks - Mini. They last much longer than the ice packs that came with this machine! I highly recommend that you get them, too.",4
"The unit itself is great. Does exactly what it’s advertised to do! I usually have to fill it 1-2x a day depending on how hot it is and how high I have the fan, I also usually have the switch out ice packs a few times a day as well. It’s definitely not an ac but it does cool the air quite nicely. The only downfall are the ice packs, they’re essentially useless. Ice packs I had on hand cooled way better. Their ice packs broke after a week and only stayed frozen for maybe 30 minutes before I had to re freeze. I recommend the unit but I would definitely buy different ice packs to go with it.",4
"Been looking for a pair of gaming earphones so I needed a mic. Tried these out and the value of the sound quality seems okay. They don’t stay on your ear as easy as you would expect as the adjustability isn’t that easy to use.Function-wise, they have decent volume and clarity but the mic quality is lacking, especially in terms of volume.",4
"These are buds are better than expected for casual PC gaming (wanting/needing to still hear the room). But with the right size ear “pads” the do a great job blocking out sound. The mic has a slight static sound at times, not noticeable by me and not very frequentBut overall pleased with this purchase",4
"I use this for my ps5. The sound is good wish it was louder with more bass but its good enough. The mic is definitely the weakest point so far. Firstly I dont like that it plays the mic sound through the headset when its unmuted ive gotten used to it but its still annoying hearing my breathing. I also dont like the quality of the mic and it peaks very easily despite me keeping it away from my mouth most of the time. Otherwise the headset feels really comfortable, it connects easily and quickly to the ps5, theres a somewhat quiet liw battery beep but i like that it lets you charge while you are still using it.",4
"This G533 Wireless was my first ""Amazon Renewed"" purchase. From what I've read, more often than not these are returned unused products. I was in luck as this was obviously a return that wasn't used at all.It came in a nondescript box, with the headset and accessories inserted in a Ziploc bag. The charging cable and wireless dongle are authentic Logitech G accessories, and were bubble-wrapped separately. All the protective peel-offs on the headset were also intact and undisturbed. And most importantly, the ear cups and headband cushion were extremely clean. The original packaging was probably damaged so technically it couldn't be sold as ""new"".Anyhow, once I got it unboxed, I plugged in the receiver and turned on the headset. Immediately G Hub recognized it. I ran it through the sound test and it was great, with no discernible distortions. Mind you, it wasn't perfect, but it's certainly good enough. I then tested the mic using Zoom as well as doing recordings through Windows., Although they weren't superb, my voice was clear and understandable - certainly good enough for Discord.Although I do find it somewhat bulky and heavy, it sits comfortably on my head, and the cups fit over my ears snugly. The overall fit is firm, but not constrictive. I also like how the the mic extends and retracts as well, and the flex is adequate and not flimsy.I'm more than satisfied with this purchase. The only caveat being it's limited connectivity. It would've been nice if this was Bluetooth-enabled, or at the least if it had wired functionality. Regardless, the G533 Wireless is a very capable, no-nonsense headset, fit for any gamer. Happy shopping!Edit: After having these for a few days now, I will say it does start feeling tight during long sessions. And my ears do get hot after awhile being confined in the cups. If these had more breathability, and a way to lessen the tension somehow, these would be perfect. Still, this thing's a keeper in my books!",4
"The media could not be loaded. This was a gift for my son, and he is enjoying it immensely.Especially the ease of use, the lights, the ability to hold things in the tray. He also likes that it blends in well when turned off (see pic), but the lights then match the rest of his accessories when they’re all on (sorry - no pic).I’m glad he’s happy and will certainly keep the product, but my only 2 ‘complaints’ would be:1) While the assembly was simple and didn’t require instructions (plain box, 3 parts, absolutely no further info), I still would have liked some basic instructions instead of relying solely on intuition.I found the pole fit better one way (less wobbly) than the other and I tried to not push too hard in case it’s not intended to ‘snap’ into place either and broke - rendering it useless.2) If I’m correct and it’s not suppose to ‘snap in’; that the pole portion of the stand itself feels flimsy and weak. It isn’t as solid as I’d like and it still wiggles more than I’d like to see on an item that will get daily use (see video). So I do worry I will have to replace the entire thing if he’s not careful and it snaps. Or I’m considering gluing it at both ends to give it more stability and longevity.We’ll see what happens!",4
"The build quality is nice, but they weren't comfortable on any of the adults in my house. The ear cups are small, they're either going to press on the top or lobes of your ear which just leads to pain after a while. And that's assuming you can get them over your ears. Fully extended it's comfortable on the 13 year old but a little small for everyone else.The audio is okay. Far from great but good enough to hear directional stuff in game. The mic sounds kinda cheap. It came through clear but people said I sounded like I was talking into a can. If you're locked in at this price point and have a smallish head, they're fine. They feel like they'd last a while.",4
"Delivers clear sound, but comfort for long periods is compromised by thin earpads, allowing the drivers to touch the ears. Both sides of the connection area are prone to cracking",4
Unlike the Kraken v3 pro wireless with haptics this Blackshark v2 has a clean crisp sound. no base no rattling. Just constant clear sound. I need more than that when gaming and doing video creations. I need the environment to,4
Great product that makes headset/ pc area look neat. RGBs are cool but you can’t turn them off unless you unplug it. Also wireless charging works but isn’t mag safe,4
This is a decent replacement for the mic on a gaming headset. By no means the best quality but it does hold up and it does the job. Not too muffled or distant.,4
"Why should I have to install additional software to make my regular old 3.5mm pin plug headphones work correctly?My Plantronics Gamecom's don't require anything extra, just plug them in.They are comfortable though.",4
"The mic works fine, just know you have to make sure you don’t insert the mic all the way. It works perfectly. Mic sounds crisp and clear after test were made.",4
"I wear these basically all day for meetings, music, podcasts, and gaming.Pros:Good, though not amazing sound quality. I think these provide good sound for this price point. Plenty of clarity and range. The microphone works just fine, and the ear pads do a good job with passive ""noise cancellation."" I also find them reasonably comfortable.Cons:After not quite 3 years of use, the plastic/vinyl/whatever material that coats the ear and head cushions has started peeling off pretty badly. It just flakes off. Also, the ear cups are coming detached from the main housing of the speakers. I've already repaired one with epoxy, but the epoxy did not bond well to the plastic, so I'm going to have to try again, probably with electrical tape. Hopefully they are repairable, because I like the sounds quality of these headphones, and it would be a shame to have to chuck them because the stupid ear cup won't stay attached.",4
"So far I've been using RIG product for few years, previously using RIG 500E and giving me a good impression for wearing for long section comfort for the headset, even listen to music is great.RIG 800 Pro is a great wireless headset in my opinion, this headset can go pretty loud even you max out can listen the detail without wear it. Great memory form earcup but the isolation for the headset not that good and wear for long section can easily sweat. Battery life is great with the charging port but why micro USB? Build quality for this headset is still same as my old RIG 500e plastic but lightweight and feels like weightless while wearing on it.I've been trying on gaming for few games like competitive fps games I can hear very detail footstep from which direction coming from. For music I can hear more detail than before the bass is quite loud and detail, listening to J-rock song makes the song pack a punch. Even I enjoy watching movie with this headset is great!But If you looking for a good mic headset, this is not a product for you. The mic is bad, really bad. I can't speak softly but keep picking up my environment sound like fans or my mouse clicking.And I had tired connect to my Nintendo switch through my dock and it works!Great upgrade and I love it.",4
Does not correctly charge xbox controller but we'll worth the purchase. Very bright. Holds a controller and headphones very convenient.,4
I live it well enough.,4
This xbox one controller and headphones stand works as intended. The headphone stand part its tall enough to allow more room at the buttom. The RGB lights are in the center and switchable by a single button. The controller charging base is shaped in a way that other compatible controllers may not be directly plugged in because of the countour does not fit. I was able to manage that by using the two usb a ports at the back. One wired to headset one wired to the controller.,4
"The quality is great, the mic is clear but the mute switch doesn’t work. My previous headset had one that worked great but this one is a disappointment.",4
"When the batteries are good it’s gives good effect, but batteries seems to not last long since you always have it on",4
Comfort ok but not perfect,4
Work great so far. Had all the power cords. The cd door was stuck closed when I tried to open it. All in all so far so good.,4
"Everything came in brand new, like well-wrapped up in a box. Now, two things I didn't like, and I had to make a little adjustment: 1) Surprisingly, it came with the 3 color connectors which brings back memories when I played GameCube, N64, PS1, you name it, but my TV doesn't support it, I mean nowdays most TV's and consoles have HDMI ports now, so luckily i had an HDMI chord laying around somewhere, I used it. 2) the controller, specifically the left stick, so when I started playing games, it rotates fine, it doesn't lay on one side, but when you press it down, it doesn't work and I tried it few times. So for some games, I had to go to Options and picked a different buttons layout that I'm more comfortable with and practice few times until I get good as I was.",4
"This is a fun and cute item. It is not sturdy, and sometimes misses the toothpick",4
Family loved it. Thought it was cute.,4
"I bought this for a themed party, I did not expect a whole lot from the price, but in the photos it does look like it has some texture/ furriness to it. That is not the case, it is a flat print embedded in the fabric. The quality is not ""high-end"" but not overly thin & again, referencing the price you are paying it is good enough. It worked fine for what I needed it for and is quality enough to be able to reuse it- probably multiple times!",4
Works but kinda cheap looking . Very thin,4
"As much as I would love to have a real Cow hide table runner, it just isn’t something that is available for multiple reasons. Mostly because of financial reasons. So when I saw this Linen Cow print table runner, I thought that this was a great idea.For one thing, it would be super expensive for us to secure a real cowhide. I thought that I should try this Linen table runner and see if it would look nice enough to keep on display in our home. The length of the table runner is 13” X 71”, and has Cowhide print over the entire length of the table runner. I was able to choose from a black or a brown cowhide print, and I thought that the brown cowhide was best for our home. Both looked beautiful.As good as it looks on our buffet, it is missing a few of the qualities that I would most prefer. For one, I know that this is just a print, but I wish that the fabric was a bit thicker. I know that it isn’t possible for the print to have more depth, or a tactile texture to it, but the table runner is just missing that main part of what would make it spectacular. I have seen faux fur table runners and I wasn’t impressed with them at all. I do think that if you want the look of cowhide, this is probably the best route to go. Whether I get absolutely everything that I want or not.When you see the table runner in my pictures, it really looks amazing. The table runners look amazing on the manufacturer’s site as well. And although it is an amazing look, it’s not quite making it as a replacement for the real thing. I personally don’t know if there is even a way to make this style of print any better.I want to say that the tailoring is excellent. The print is excellent. It’s a great length. The pricing is excellent, for a print. It’s easy to clean, and to maintain. Certainly a lot easier to take care of than a real cowhide. With everything that I have written, I can tell that I really like the Linen Cow table runner.",4
"nice, but expected it to be a little thicker",4
I really am enjoying the sunflower placemats and the chair cushions.,4
Cute. Easy to clean,4
AI really like it,4
A bit pricy. Not sure I would spend this much again. They are cute and pretty sturdy. I do like that they are reversible - that’s a plus.,4
"So pretty, a little smaller than I thought but I loved them. Only negative is that the fabric is light weight/ thin.",4
"These placemats have a very pretty design, bright, cheery, and they have a red cardinal in it which is what I really wanted. They are made of plastic, so they are pretty but pvc vinyl. That makes them easy to clean, and wipe off after use.I would suggest that the manufacturer consider rolling the placemats instead of folding them for future packaging., as it takes a while for the fold to come out. (Four stars for folding instead of rolling.)The price is reasonable for the quality of the product.",4
"It's cheap and bought impulsively. Its nice to have a place to put my toothpicks rather than their original box. This does not hold a lot of toothpicks but enough I suppose. It works as intended and is nice you don't have to manhandle all the other toothpicks to get one to use though. Also this is pretty cute to have out on the kitchen counter/table. It's plastic so well see how long it lasts but for the cost, this wasn't a horrible impulse purchase.",4
"I have 2 already and just order a 3rd. My second Chromebook did not come with the stylus/pen and the seller quickly shipped me the stylus/pen. This is a great Chromebook for all our basic needs. I use mine on flights to get some work done. I really like the tent/tablet mode for watching videos. Some of my favorite apps are also available on this Chromebook. The seller is very good to work with and I just ordered one more for my daughter. The quality is what you would expect for a used educational edition Chromebook. Some buyers expect that theirs will be flawless. So far on all of mine the screen has been scratch free. Once I get them I clean them really well and even put a coat of armor all on the housing to shine it back up. Both of the Chromebooks I have received have been in excellent condition and fully functional. These things have 4gb of ram and a roughly 2.5ghz quad core processor, so apps run very smooth. Video quality is great, but I'm not sure what resolution the screen is. I recommend the 500e to anyone looking for a cheap Chromebook suitable for browsing, watching videos, and playing the occasional games.",4
"Overall this chromebook has been the best and most reliable type of laptop I have ever owned. I do my work on it, I watch all of my streaming services on it, the battery lasts days before needing a charge, and the touch screen makes it all better and easier! Definitely recommend to those who need a laptop not for gaming!",4
"This laptop works well so far. Just docking off half a point for the absence of internal battery as mentioned by other reviews.I bought this laptop to give away to someone i know. Basically, decided on this laptop considering the upgradeability factor and also from experience of using this model as my work machine.The packging was good and the refurbished information came with it as well. The windows activation was a breeze. The front lid of the machine came with a matte sticker finish to possibly hide any previous usage blemishes.I've done a couple upgrades so far. The laptop came with a 256GB SSD albeit a 2.5 inch SATA model. I've upgraded this to a SK Hynix P31 Gold 1TB NVME. I had to buy a 2.5 inch SATA to NVME bay to accomplish this.I've also updated the Wifi controller. It came with a 8265NGW chip. I've upgraded this to Intel AX210NGW. This will support Wifi 6/6E and Bluetooth 5.2/5.3. I've tested this and noticed definite speed increase on the wifi connection. I needed to download the Intel drivers for Bluetooth and Wifi beforehand and install the drivers after installing the new chip. If you are familiar with changing M2 type drives it will be a similar process along with plugging in some antenna connections.Finally, recommend downloading Lenovo Vantage from Microsoft app store and doing all the necessary system updates along with updating the Thunderbolt 3 firmware as T480 is known to have issues with Thunderbolt 3 with old firmware.",4
"This met my expectations for the price. I can use it for my daily writing and internet use, it's not gigantic so I can fit it in a smaller bag, and it has a very responsive touchscreen (honestly better quality than I expected for the price). It acts as a 2-1 tablet/computer, while having a much sturdier clamshell hinge than a typical tablet with a keyboard attached. It is much more comfortable to type with in my lap, and feels less delicate (less easily broken). The battery life is pretty standard and no complaints (around 5 hours).Some downsides that were not easily noticeable from viewing it online:- The 11 inch size refers to the viewing portion of the screen, which has a large border, so the actual laptop is more like 13 inches. This was mildly disappointing because I really wanted it to be as small as possible to fit in my day bag. (But it's still fairly small.)- There are no backlit keys on the keyboard.- It is a bit heavy for its size (but not unmanageable).The refurbish job was pretty good. The only issue was the trackpad seemed a little too clacky (maybe loose), but it worked perfectly.",4
"The Chromebook came as advertised with the exception that it does not have a backlit keyboard as it was listed as having. It is also completely out of it's warranty period, which was not mentioned. Overall the Chromebook is excellent. It is a little larger and heavier than I expected, but not so much that it is going to be a problem. The picture quality is excellent. As with all Chromebook's the audio quality is good, but the volume is very low. This is compounded by the speakers being on the bottom (do the people who designed this have a different way of holding a laptop where speakers on the bottom is a good listening position?) Downloading any volume boosting extension will solve the volume problem. It has a large keyboard and touch pad, and the touchscreen works well. It charges relatively quickly and the battery seems to last. I have noticed that with 100% battery, when you unplug the charger, there is a noticeable dimming of the screen, which I will have to look into. I've emailed the seller and I am waiting to hear back about the backlit keyboard and warranty. I am withholding 1 star for not having a backlit keyboard 1 for not mentioning it being out of warranty and 1 waiting to see how this is handled. I will update the rating and comments as soon as the dust settles.Update. I had a response in under 30 minutes. They apologized for the confusion and gave me the options to either return it for a full refund or they would send me $20. I took the $20 which will buy me a keyboard light. Promt, polite and offered a solution acceptable to us both. Great customer service. Changed the rating to 4 stars.I have a defacto 30 day warranty, in the return window. Lenovo has a 2 year, in home, service in 24 hours warranty I can purchase, that also covers the screen and accidental damage (if I drop it and crack the screen I'm covered) for $122.45 (plus a warranty reinstatement fee if $22). Even with a bogus reinstatement fee its a good deal. The seller, Amazon and Lenovo customer service all did a good job on this one. 2 thumbs up! 👍👍",4
"I needed a new Chromebook when my old one's updates expired and it started acting weird. I chose this one because the price, the reviews, the specs, and the expiration date of updates met or exceeded my minimum qualifications.PROS: I am pleased so far with almost all aspects of the machine. I still have to do a little fine-tuning with the settings but overall, I am pleased.CONS: 1. Although I was supposed to get a power cord, there was not one in the box. This was not an issue since I could use the one from my old CB.2. I hate the case. My old CB had a textured plastic case and was very easy to grip and stayed put. I have to tightly grip this smooth metal case when lifting it which creates pain in my hand. It slips around on my lap when I use it. I have to grip the corner. I finally resorted to using a small bathmat upside down to help with the stability.Bottom line: I like the machine but hate the smooth metal case.Added note: FYI: This model is supported through June 2025. When the support for my previous Chromebook ended, I planned to continue using it while I shopped for a replacement. However, the device was pretty much unusable after that date - so much garbage, pop-ups, etc. started showing up on my screen. So take that into consideration when buying this model.",4
"This Lenovo is my first Chromebook but umpteenth Lenovo laptop. First, I held my breath and clicked Used - Very Good from Amazon Warehouse Deals to save almost $100. Small cosmetic imperfections on sides of the item. Well, I can't see any imperfections anywhere. Couldn't tell the difference between this and a brand new machine. The laptop looks great, the large screen is awesome, the operation is snappy with the I3, no performance issues with only 4 GB RAM, I am very pleased with this machine, it fully meets my Lenovo build expectations.One thing that surprised me but shouldn't is that this machine is way heavier than our Lenovo X1 Carbon gen 4. 2.7 lbs vs 4.3 lbs. But, having the larger screen is so great and its a touch screen to boot.It is Chrome OS that causes the loss of one star. It took me 2 days to configure this machine and I've been building PCs since the late 90's. The problem I had is probably not one that most people will have. I subscribe to G Suite for Business and I guess that when it comes to Chromebooks, the Suite administration sticks its tentacles in there whether you want it or not.One major issue was that Google Play was disabled in my Chromebook (a nonstarter) with a message that said ""this is managed by your administrator"". I'm the administrator and I did not disable Google Play for any of my devices. Turns out G Suite disables Google Play by default. So just go into G Suite and enable Google Play. Not so fast, navigating G Suite is a nightmare, completely non-intuitive, at least for me. Ultimately after a day of Google searches and fruitlessly trying all kinds of switches in G Suite, a Google support person set me straight. All was fine after speaking with him.The next challenge was Microsoft Office integration. I also subscribe to Office 365. Eat another day, the MS apps would not let me sign-in with my account. Call to Microsoft support fixed that. Then the next challenge was passing files between OneDrive and Google Drive. Installing File System for Windows was the answer. Finally, I had Chrome OS configured the way I needed it to be. In 2020, it should not be this hard to get your new laptop up and running.",4
Ease to use ease to set up speed not so fast but it get the job dun,4
Yeah I got them put them on to perfect except perfect on my desk sometime in another I'll figure out how to get it hooked up to the Internet but I love it,4
"I really like this computer, it’s everything I need. Great value, good quality, long battery life,",4
"Just as stated in the header and as many have rated it is bargain for a reason. I purchase one as a small personal device as i have my phone and pc the second one was for my child as a learning device and a first introductory lap top/tablet as he is 5 years old and is in home-school program. The price is a steal if you are looking on the cheap side. But make sure you dont get upset when it may come with defects.Pros: Value, 2-in-1, compact.Cons: No cap button and defects vary.As i stated I bought two as shown in the pics; the first one I bought seemed to be brand new never touch; no problems, so i decided to get a second to appease my child as he was immediately drawn to it and i figured it would be a great tool for his schooling. some of the best features from Google is the supervision so i can monitor what my child is doing limiting how much time he is using it for and so on. Sorry if this is a run on. the only fustrating thing is the No Cap button as u are forced to shift + what ever letter ur trying to capitalize in replace is the quick button to google search which i find annoying retraining the muscle memory of my fingers.Another thing is that some time it will not power on and you have to google why and find out why there is a refresh button. They also provided two different charge cord DO NOT SWAP! Other wise it will crash; any way hope this help in deciding if it is worth the buy. iMO it is as I wanted something not expensive does the basics and is both a lap/ tablet.**** UPDATE ****in order to stop with the google search button you can change the keyboard layout or its control functions in Setting > Devices > Keyboard> Custom KeyBoard Keys... It took me almost 1month to figure it out. Hope this help some one.",4
"Although it says many specs, its not exactly what I expected. The laptop needed to be heavily updated, including updating to Windows 11, some required Lenovo updates, along with updating some of the AMD drivers.However, regardless of that, the screen looks really good and the speed seems quite decent as well. The touch screen works pretty well.On the exterior, there are a few scratches around the bottom of it, but I think that is standard for used laptop like this. It is otherwise clean.Battery life is pretty great and tight. Can remain steady for a 4-6 hours doing light tasks.In summary, the quality is incredible for the price. The build is strong and as long as you know how to use any other Windows computer, this one should be easy to use as well. Despite it being refurbished and besides a few minor issues mentioned earlier, its as good as new.",4
"Affordable and still fast on chromeOS. I have a couple of peeves with the OS which is why I docked a star. By terms of hardware, it's plenty for school and work, and it's in pretty much new quality for being refurbished.",4
"Slick product, light, tight hinges, value for money, keyboard feels great, No freeze, memory operating well. Would be nice if a stylus can be inconcluded.",4
"I bought a few of these for my small nonprofit. Out of the box they feel a little flimsy and not as solid as I would have liked. They come with Windows 10 Home, so I had to buy the Pro suite for about $100 each computer. My fault for not reading thoroughly. The color is very aesthetically pleasing, and my users haven't had any problems with them. They were easy enough to set up and seem to work fine. Hoping they hold up over time.",4
You get what you pay for. This was the most affordable laptop I could find with this size screen that ran windows 11. As long as you aren't a serious gamer it should be fine for emails and internet. I do play Age of Empires and it buzzes some but I knew it was not a game machine when I bought it.,4
Smaller than expected but ok for my needs. “Restored condition “ so we’ll see how it holds up. All satisfied so far for $$$,4
It’s a good Chromebook,4
"I've had it only a few days, but so far I'm very pleased. It came in A+ condition, WAY ahead of time, just like new, the diagnostics (F12 at bootup) are good, and it is a lively, very capable unit with an excellent display (at the very top of my gotta-be's was a matte screen, I use it in a very bright environment, and it meets that requirement perfectly). My only disappointment is that it doesn't have separate volume/mute buttons (it has Fn +/- volume, not nearly as handy, I guess I'll get used to it). One surprise: I assumed that there wouldn't be any damage insurance available, so beforehand I found a deal from Progressive, $200+ for 3 years, $50 deductible. OK I thought, not great but I'll buy it after getting the laptop. When I checked out, they offered 4-yr, no deductible insurance for about $150. That's a great deal for a 3 yr old laptop, surprised they don't trumpet it in the description.An update after 3 days: I found a few problems with the software that they should have caught before shipping. I got in touch with them and they immediately sent me a UPS return label for a replacement, but that would take over a week before I get one back with a mirror image of this one, which it set up exactly to my specs. Not an appealing idea. Fortunately it still has a warranty so got in touch with Dell. After getting cut off twice, the 3rd agent did a good job fixing it. So a caveat: if you get this, get someone who knows IT to check it out (I'm a little smarter than the average IT bear, so at least I knew where to look for problems). Unfortunately then I'm downgrading my rating to 4 stars.",4
"Everything works great. Very responsive. Works great as a tablet. Speakers aren't great, but for the price they are. NO keyboard back light.",4
"I like the slim look of the laptop, only con is the mouse pad malfunctions on regular. I needed a budget friendly laptop for a new job working from home due to my last HP laptop internal fan stop working. But it serves its purpose. F.Y.I NOT TOUCH SCREEN.",4
Not very thrilled about the screen. I thought it was a touch screen,4
I purchased this laptop in hopes it was a touchscreen unfortunately it is not. However I will keep it because it is lighter than my old one and it will work fine. Amazon or whoever needs to change the specs!,4
"I recently bought a renewed 2017 Apple MacBook Air with a 1.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD storage, and it’s been a pretty decent product. For everyday tasks like browsing, streaming, and using apps, it runs smoothly. The 128GB storage is a bit small if you have a lot of files, but the fast SSD helps with quick boot times and file access. The build quality is great, as you’d expect from Apple, with a sturdy aluminum body and a bright 13-inch screen. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the trackpad is responsive. The battery life is another great feature, lasting a long time on a single charge.As a renewed model, this MacBook Air is a great deal. It’s a cost-effective way to get a reliable Apple laptop without spending a fortune. It’s not the most powerful laptop out there, but for general use and for what I’m using it for on the day to day, it’s enough. Additionally, the slim and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around. If you don’t need a ton of storage, this 2017 MacBook Air is a solid choice that’s easily portable with good performance and decent battery life. My only wish is that the screen quality was a little better. Overall, it’s a good laptop.",4
It works very well just don’t like how there’s two cracks but there small cracks so doesn’t really bother me that much for a really cheap laptop I’m very impressed love it !!!!!!!!!!!!,4
It was good for the purpose why it wa,4
"I received this computer the day after I ordered it, and it looked as new. I set it up, updated Windows, and found that the SD card reader didn't recognize any cards I put in it. It also didn't recognize another monitor plugged into the HDMI port. I took a clue from another reviewer, downloaded the Driver Booster app, and ran it to find and update drivers. Once that was done, the SD card reader worked, and the second monitor did. So, I am giving this four stars. Those two things should have worked out of the box.After that, I found the computer fast and so far does what I want it to do, but it does have issues running the latest Photoshop, but for the price, I am happy with it. I like the keyboard, and the fact that it is lighted helps in lower light. The computer has a very fast start-up.One thing that is not ideal is the trackpad. It doesn't respond to my input well, and it sometimes has to have my input twice.All in all, I am happy so far with the laptop that I am using to type this now.Two weeks in and It's been great. It charges fast, takes maybe 30 minutes to fully charge, and the battery life is good. The touchpad is great. I have never liked touchpads, but the one on this computer works great.",4
"The media could not be loaded. So at first this was a 5/5 stars I went cheap and got the acceptable at first I only noticed like 3 debts at the corners I didn’t complain cs the laptop WORKS AMAZING it came charged the battery life last long unless your playing Roblox or using an app that uses a big amount of battery I only got the laptop because I’m 18 freshmen in college with a prime job and it was pretty affordable for me at first I didn’t notice this but it came with like this sticker that covered all the scratches that the laptop had under it the sticker thing came up and that’s when I seen all the stretches on the laptop I don’t complain cs it’s something I can cover up with stickers which is what I was already gonna do before the sticker thing came off the volume on the laptop is amazing as you can hear at first I was skeptical about getting it based on peoples reviews but once’s I got it I was like okay for a laptop that is Acceptable It’s great just know the difference they sell acceptable, good and I think the third one is great condition I could be wrong but when you get the acceptable you’ll get one like mine but still works great so don’t get it twisted I’ll see in another year how the laptop holds up",4
"Could use more onboard memory and it is slightly bulky, but at $215 you won't find a better machine. The one I received showed little, if any signs of use. Very fast, reasonable screen resolution. I bought this to use to live tune a Holley Sniper fuel injection system and to surf the net and watch movies. It is more than sufficient.",4
"It’s a computer for $100 give or take. You really can expect only so much out of it. It does the trick. Only issue to me its that it’s a pain in the butt do download google chrome on it, which, I wouldn’t care about using necessarily however apparently a lot of programs online only work with chrome. Not a dealbreaker though. It’s a little slow but she gets the job done. If you want a computer to blow you away with how great it is, spend some more money and get a better one. BUT if you need a nice little laptop to get the essentials done, this will do the trick. But if you’re going to get all nitpicky then invest some more cash in a different computer.",4
"The HP 14 is a great choice for those looking for a basic laptop under $200, but it’s not for gamers, designers, or anyone who does more than the basics on their computer. Most surprisingly, it’s even decent for streaming video and for cord cutters who can take advantage of the HDMI port to connect to a larger display.The basics: It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode, but you can easily switch out of S mode if you need to install additional programs not found on the Microsoft store. I turned it off with 4 minutes of use, so that’s a breeze. And of course, this laptop features a 14-inch 1920 x 1080 display, an Intel Celeron N4020 processor, and 4GB of RAM.**Here are some of the highlights of the HP 14:*** **Great for basic tasks:** The HP 14 can handle basic tasks such as browsing the web, checking email, and using productivity software, but with only 4GB of RAM, I experienced some slowdowns when I had many tabs open in my browser or was running multiple programs at once.* **Long battery life:** The laptop can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge. I was definitely impressed!* **Comfortable keyboard:** The keyboard is bouncy with a generous click and plenty of room for typing.if you like firmer keyboards, this one may not be your jam.* **SD card slot:** The HP 14 includes an SD card slot, which is a rarity for laptops in this price range.perfect for me,because my trail cam’s card can be emptied daily with ease!* **HDMI port:** as mentioned, this is great for cord cutters who want to connect to a larger display or projector. My last cheap laptop was twice the price of this one and didn’t have an hdmi or a card reader.**Here are some things to keep in mind:*** **Small touchpad:** The touchpad is small and can be difficult to use.* **Dim screen:** The screen is a bit dim and I found it impossible to use outside no matter how I adjusted the display settings.* **Low storage:** 64GB of storage may not be enough for some users.* **Limited RAM:** 4GB of RAM limits multitasking capabilities.I don’t know yet if those last two items are upgradable, but I’ll check into it if things get bogged down over the next few weeks!**Overall, the HP 14 is a great laptop for students, casual users, and anyone looking for a basic laptop under $200, especially if you don't plan on running multiple programs at once. However, if you need a laptop for more demanding tasks, you may want to consider a model with more RAM.**",4
Satisfied,4
"I received this chromebook yesterday, especially for my upcoming travelling needs. So far looks good. It comes with one SD card but there is no place in this chromebook to insert that SD card. So there is an issue with what is mentioned in the description and the actual product which they shipped. May be they have two very similar products but one is without SD card. One more thing to mention, keyboard visibility will be bad in low light.",4
"Hay! So I originally got this for my mother and there's no real issue with the computer. Very sturdy, very well made, just the force of having to log in with your google account is a tad annoying",4
"This computer does everything that i needed it for.. I use it for everything except work as I am am retired. Use it take care of bill payments, bank reconciliation as well as for pleasure. It is fast when you are shopping in different sites and listening to music. My wireless headphones pair easily . It is also easy to set up when first starting out. I enjoy it and am pleased with my purchase. It has Microsoft Office so I don't think doing work would be any problem.",4
Computer works as it should no defects but charger is not working properly. The charger is very hot after just a few minutes of charging,4
"My daughter has some reading programs to work on over summer. For the low price I paid for this refurbish I was more than happy with it for her. The condition was great very little scuff or scratches, screen was perfect. It even comes with a charger. My only problem is the W key doesn’t work well. You have to press it super hard. Unfortunately her password for school has a W so this is a slight annoyance and why I deducted a star.",4
Delivered on time and performs well but from 2021 so it is a fair value but not a great value. Dell is a good make with a good rating for the model.,4
"It is decent for the price and it was supposed to be new. The speed is no issue. The size and the screen is ok for the price point I chose. It was easy to set up. It runs on all the up to date programs. It does sometimes turn off for no reason or be hard to turn on, so much so that I be thinking it's going to die and not come back on (but this I think is an HP issue not the seller). It came with a free year of Microsoft Suite which is a huge selling point. However, I have learned a lot over the last week ab buying products like this on Amazon. So if I have to buy another laptop from Amazon. I would buy the Amazon renewed premium since it has a 1yr warranty and comes with a check list of what was tested, battery life, etc.",4
"Very nice laptop. After purchasing - Microsoft Office, Webroot Internet Security and a new HP Office Jet 250 Mobile Printer and completing the transfer of all our files, I ran into a Big Issue ! Then on 7/19/24, I went to turn it on the laptop and it would not turn on. Needless to say, I was in a panic mode. Was I about to lose evertything But, Thanks to Amazon Technical, we were able to get the laptop up and running. Needless to say I was Happy - Happy - Happy !",4
"Ok, I will try not to go too long in my review. Because I have waited a LONG time just to get this (long story short, UPS couldn't find my place, sent it back to headquarters or whatever, had to get a refund and reorder it AGAIN) that now, I could see how this laptop holds up. And so far, it holds up pretty well. The laptop was in a box and another, smaller box. Very well packaged. The cord was wrapped up nicely to the side. When I opened the laptop, it was fully charged, which was nice. Now, you could get a mouse for it if you are not fond of the touch screen because they have two USB ports. I am using 1 port for a fan to help cool it and know the 2nd one I could use a mouse...or charge my phone. Whatever.I also like the fact that this has 8gb...I have seen a lot higher prices for just 4gb so, to get this, with 8, very nice features, good ratings, all for a price of around $250 or so (taxes and such), this laptop was worth the (unfortunately long) wait. I will continue to work on this more and see if there are any cons. I do know I get a 90 day warranty, which is also a nice bonus.",4
"What I like:It is built like a tank and will probably resist careless handling better than cheaper model computers.Sufficient memory to run the newer applications like Windows, 11, and Microsoft office as well as casual use photo editing, such as for making reports and magazine articles to submit.Really loving the back lighted keyboard, and the fact that the keys require a slightly harder tap then the cheap knock offs do. It's more like a typewriter and less like a cell phone if that gives you an idea.It is already anti-glare screen. You interferes with your sleeping ability if you work at night so you don't have to buy a separate blue light filter.Display is nice and crisp.What I do not like:The back lighted keyboard times out fairly quickly, and goes dark again. There's probably a set for that. I haven't figured out.The processor is slow,(by standards available in March 2024) so if you care about streaming, high definition, video or high resolution games, like second life, you might have to do a little wizard to scale down your settings and expectations.Incidentally, the tech papers I saw said you cannot overclock this model, so you're out of luck there.this thing is incredibly heavy compared to newer computers of similar size and even 17 inch ones! That makes it unpleasant to take to the café to work on with other writers... if you have a physical handicap, I do not recommend that you buy a computer this heavy.if you have a physical handicap or weak hand strength, I do not recommend that you buy a computer this heavy.(I regret the impulse buy, but it was an excellent deal and much needed.)The battery also seems to get tired quicker than my old Acer computer, but it is a much higher horsepower as far as the amount of memory it runs so perhaps that's the trade-off.(I am not saying the battery is bad)The cord is bulky but again it was cutting edge six years ago so I can't really complain too much that it is taking a lot of room and relatively heavy compared to any other device I have.(hoping this makes it resistant to small animals chewing it.)😝Like a ferret or a bunny or a cat... or even a budgie! Yeah seriously.(pets will be pets.)----------------(anti-monopoly, software rant... skip ahead if you like)Frankly, I hate the layout of Windows 10 and 11, but I am also chronically angry about Microsoft and Google and Apple dominating the digital world so there you go...* nothing* short of open source code, and lowering the monthly rental fee for their software like Word and Photoshop to something like five dollars a month for home users, will appease me - and other nerdy people who have taken the red Matrix pill if you know what I mean, -and allowing us to download an *actual copy * of the program, so we own what we are paying for , instead of forcing us to rent this stuff, and use the cloud - if you have Financial hard times, you are up a creek, )I am also vigorously opposed to saving my stuff in the cloud. But that is a problem with Google and certain other applications, and they do know exactly what they're doing if you read the business reports .It is nobody else's business what I work on and if I work on it, and where I choose to save it... they certainly don't have my permission to keep a copy (did you know they were sued for academic infringement roughly 20 years ago when they stole stuff to post on Google scholar ???)which they automatically do and you cannot prevent unless you do not use Google at all(!!!).----------------------But that is more of a gunboat marketing monopoly tactic that has nothing to do with the quality of the hardware I am holding. They are hostage to the system as much as I am. (manufacturers, build what they are told to build so they can get paid.)That said this was a over $2000 computer, six years ago when the processor was new release. I am satisfied it will serve me for at least the next three years.I will also note that it does not fit as easily into certain laptop, protective sleeves, and cases that are designed for 14 to 15 inch machines. Because it's kind of fat.! LolLike a tank😜but that is part of why I bought a brand-name and not a cheap knockoff from overseas that will probably break when I sneeze.",4
The computer was mostly fine. I just needed something a little lighter. The keyboard is a little on the hard side and I've been used to something softer with a brand I've been using for the last few years. I decided to return it as I wasn't enjoying the typing experience but everything else was okay.,4
Bought for a friend and was told it worked well.,4
I really do love this MacBook. It may be a bit old and has a few battery problems. But if I keep it charged it works very well. Since it's an older version try not to run several things at the same time or else it will run slow but other than that I love it!!!,4
Speed is not as fast but it’s just home computer not for work.,4
Computer works great and I love the memory size...only push back is cannot download Google Chrome,4
This Laptop is some great bang for you buck! It’s works great for basic use like streaming and browsing the web. It runs fast most of the time and I have had very little problems with it. One thing to note is it isn’t great for gaming. That is to be expected. It runs simple games but nothing more advanced. Overall a good purchase!,4
"Looks great and performs well, but only issue I feel was Camera. Lacking Camera quality and projects less sound, other than that speed, touch and looks everything was great for this price.",4
This laptop seems almost new with very minor scratches on its black finish. One surprise i got is that it wasnt the Alcantara finish (cloth) but a metal finish. Its works like a regular laptop and for a bit over 300$ its a good price.,4
"I've only had it for a few weeks now. So far I'm very satisfied with this laptop. Computer was cleaned well, looked like new. So far I've had no problems with it. Does just what I need it too, and what a great price. Hopefully it will have a good long life.",4
When I first received this Laptop it wouldn't turn on from the box ... I contacted the seller whom immediately sent return slap-ons. Before I knew it a replacement machine arrived that worked perfectly. Happy buyer!,4
"I mean, it's a computer and does everything you expect from one. I don't know if it's my new headset or the new laptop, but I can almost go to the other end of the house without loosing connection. I also wanted Win 10 because 11 is a little incompatible with our software product. Thsi fit the bill.The only drawback is the battery; I don't know the advertised life when new, but this one expires a good bit before I can make it to my office in Texas.But, it spends 90% of it's work day on my desk, and it shines there.",4
"Recently, I had the opportunity to experience the renewed HP 17.3"" HD Touchscreen Business Laptop, and my overall satisfaction is noteworthy. Let's delve into the notable features and considerations:Pros:Speed and Generous Storage: The laptop, equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5-5500U processor, 16GB RAM, and a combination of 512GB SSD and 1TB HDD, delivers swift performance. The expansive 17.3"" touchscreen enhances productivity by providing ample workspace.Windows 11 Pro Elegance: The laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro, contributing an elevated level of sophistication and advanced functionalities for an enhanced user experience.Numeric Keypad Convenience: The inclusion of a numeric keypad is a thoughtful addition, offering practicality for tasks that involve frequent numerical input.Versatile Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a Webcam provide an array of connectivity options, catering to diverse user needs.Cons:Charging Speed: A minor drawback is the charging speed, which falls short of expectations. Users who rely on quick top-ups while on the move may find this aspect slightly inconvenient.Conclusion:In summary, the renewed HP 17.3"" HD Touchscreen Business Laptop impresses with its performance and screen size. While the charging speed is a minor concern, it doesn't significantly impact the laptop's overall functionality.Pros:Swift performance and ample storageWindows 11 Pro sophisticationNumeric keypad convenienceDiverse connectivity optionsCons:Charging speedDespite this minor inconvenience, the renewed HP laptop stands out as a reliable choice for business-oriented users seeking a spacious screen and robust performance.",4
It's a nice one,4
"There is no Windows 11 product key with the laptop. I learned earlier that the key is loaded in BIOS in new laptops.The color shown and mentioned was blue, but the laptop I got a silver laptop. Not a big deal and not worth deducting any stars, but some people might have a problem with that.Laptop works great otherwise and looks and feels very sleek",4
"The 15.6-inch Full High Definition (FHD) Touchscreen Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3511 Laptop with an Intel Core i5-1035G1 processor and an outstanding 32GB of RAM was a recent purchase of mine. I must say that in every way this laptop has surpassed my expectations and is now an integral part of my everyday life.This laptop's primary strength is its outstanding performance. Thanks to the Intel Core i5-1035G1 processor's lightning-fast performance and responsiveness, I can run a wide variety of programs simultaneously with no effort. The 32GB of RAM significantly improves performance, allowing you to work efficiently and without interruptions even when using busy programs.The 15.6-inch full-high-definition (FHD) touchscreen is a joy to work with. Images and videos have never looked so crisp and detailed. The touch features are quick and precise, making my work much simpler and more pleasant than before.The sturdy construction and long lifespan of this laptop further amaze me. The construction is sturdy, and the style is sleek and modern, giving off an air of professionalism. The keyboard's layout and key spacing make for a pleasant typing experience.The Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series 3511 has an excellent battery life. I'm not interrupted by the need to look for a power source, so I can focus on my work for longer periods of time. This convenience is especially useful for people who are frequently on the go.This laptop has a plethora of ports, making it ideal for use with a wide variety of peripherals. I appreciate the ease with which I can transfer and access my files thanks to the inclusion of USB ports, HDMI, and an SD card reader. I would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a solid, dependable laptop.",4
"It's bulky, I wanted something smaller than my Dell Latitude 5300 2 in 1 but it seems to be tough and can be charged from the left or from the right. Battery life is similar like my other laptop.",4
"This refurb laptop provides much better specs and performance for $150 than you would get for a $150 new laptop. Granted, the 6th gen i5 and Intel HD graphics are somewhat out-of-date but they are still great for everyday tasks and productivity. I also like how the SSD & RAM are upgradeable, and there is a second RAM slot so it only costs about $15 to buy a second stick of RAM and bring the total to 16GB. And while it is not “officially” upgradeable to Windows 11, I sideloaded it and I’ve got Windows 11 running great on this laptop. The 1080p full HD display is also a definite plus for a laptop of this price. My only complaints are that the laptop arrived with a subpar battery but I contacted the seller and they responded within the hour that a new one was on the way. The keyboard also isn’t backlit but that’s no big deal for me - but if it is to you than I would recommend you confirm with the seller first that it has a backlit keyboard. Overall this laptop is amazing considering its low $150 price tag.",4
"I love my new laptop, but the colors displayed on screen are just ok...not very vibrant, average for my own use, and can be fixed a bit tilting the screen at a better angle. I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use. Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a ""bling"" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive. It is not a touch screen monitor...I'm thinking people are confusing touch screen with touch pad. Keyboard is comfortable and battery has been long-running.",4
"like it, less updates, but too big too heavy. less apps. overall is good.",4
I bought this laptop which was supposed to be in excellent condition but when it arrived one of the two usb ports doesn’t work. So you might have issues with the one you buy. I plan on getting it repaired later on but overall it is a good deal.,4
"Laptop arrived clean and in great condition.Everything worked as expected except my docking station. Called tech support, they were very thorough in troubleshooting and requested the Laptop to be returned. A few days later I received a call that they would be replacing the laptop.Great customer service. Very happy with the purchase and resolution to an unforeseeable problem.100% recommend",4
"I mainly use my MacBook for productivity as well as for more intensive applications like virtualisation which it handles well. However, the battery life isn’t all that great my unit arrived with a battery cycle of around 450 which isn’t bad for a used laptop, but it drains relatively quickly even under a light load. What’s more is that it tends to heat up quite a bit. The keyboard gets uncomfortably hot and the backside can get burning hot, so much so I have to control the fans manually.I’d rate MacBook’s condition as average. On the surface the laptop was clean, however, the display’s anti-reflective coating was noticeably peeling (which looks like the picture I have attached) and the ports were also noticeably dirty. When I opened the inside the computer was incredibly dusty and dirty with grime buildup everywhere; the fans were even clogged by the dust buildup–it clearly had not been cleaned which I would have expected from a refurbished product. Additionally, charger supplied, although genuine, appears heavily used. It has multiple scratches and is bit grime, but works great.",4
Overall a good product. They could have specified that it's not compatible with Windows 11 due to the processor. I would've waited if I knew.,4
"Honestly when I made the purchase I looked back and read the reviews people left and I decided to gamble on it & im glad I did! I got mine in excellent condition!I believe that the people that had trouble with their computer probably didn’t order in excellent condition and maybe order it in acceptable condition.I will say if you are having trouble with it powering on when you get it, it’s probably the charger cord or the box. I have the Ipad 13 inch (2024) so when I plugged it in to my ipad charger it turned on!When it turned on it was working great. All the keys worked and the touchpad work. Its was light weight and the sound was amazing! The screen play was clean and the camera worked as well. It does tend to get a little heat but something too bad.",4
"Have had for quite some time now. I bought this for school & tuning, works great just a little slow and have to press some buttons a little hard at times only reason it's not 5stars! but that's to be expected as it's refurbushed. Good build, Very good batt Life! It's lightweight, very easy to setup, and looks great for what it is. It is not touch screen! If I had to choose a downside. It has terrible memory/space to save things",4
"The laptops work nicely, although one of them came with the OS not installed. So, my daughter had to download onto the computer. Also, sometimes the audio cuts out. But they're worth their price.",4
It functions super well! It’s definitely worth your money even if it does come slightly scratched around the edges!,4
"I really like this computer, but it took me awhile. I couldn't get programs to install. No way to contact customer service, so I called Amazon. They tried, but couldn't do anything for me. They suggested I call HP. HP said that I needed to register my Windows 10. They gave me a way to try to find out the product key, which didn't work. So I tried their 2nd choice of reinstalling a new version of Windows 10 for free. That worked. Now I have been able to install several programs, including MS Office, with no problems. All that took up 3 days of my time, but it's over now and I'm extremely happy with the computer. But not with the lack of customer service.",4
"Everything works great except for the web cam that stoppee working either due to a windowss update or laptop driversSo I had to reset the laptop and the web cam started working, but however I have started a return process and may yet decide to keep it",4
"Nice laptop. Fast and works great, battery life could be better. Nice clear screen.",4
"It showed up early , well packaged and exactly as described, very happy",4
"I wanted a newer MacBook, but didn’t want to pay the new price. This computer works like new. The description was not accurate though. The lid has some slight dents and a few small scratches. The screen has a small scratch on the edge. I contacted Amazon about the discrepancy and they offered me $100 credit. For what I ended up spending on it I can live with the slight imperfections. So far it has worked perfectly and the battery life is great. I don’t notice the scratch on the screen unless the screen is off. I covered the dents with some cute stickers. Only 4 stars because the seller didn’t do a good job accurately describing it.",4
"I took a huge leap of faith by purchasing this macbook from Amazon renewed... for the most part I'm satisfied. Everything is working fine, so far so good. Only one complaint. It came with some kind of sticker cover oveethe whole casing. I don't really like that, but i put a case on it anyway so I guess it's no biggie.",4

Computer seems to be grand. Only had it a couple of days but they sent an AC Adapter that won’t fit the computer. Simply unacceptable. I did contact them and they quickly responded saying there will send the correct adapter,4
"Bought this to take to work to use and get school work done. Slow at times but, does what I need it to do for what it’s worth.",4
"I did the 1tb upgrade version, so space wouldnt be a issue. The screen is as good as any laptop in the sub $1k market. Port selection and I/O is on par. Be nice if haf SD Slot, and provided stylus (Not the end of the world). Software is great, and im a huge Chromebook Supporter. The flexibility this device offers is amazing. Speakers are average, but be honest most laptop speakers are basic. I added a Penoval 2.1 USI pen, and JBL Charge 5 Speaker, and a set of Soundcore Earbuds. If looking for a upgradeable chromebook on Amazon, Id suggest this, if NEED s touchscreen. Battery life is insane, for something so small, and powerful.",4
"I bought this to replace my not-so-old Pixelbook which was succumbing to a swelling battery and no means to replace it (Thanks Google :-( ). Speed of the Acer is on par with the Pixelbook but the feel of the keyboard keys, the finish of the bezels, the screen quality and speakers don't measure up to the pixelbook. Still, I'm pleased with the purchase. By comparison with my wife's Dell XPS-13/i7, this Acer chromebook is much faster and more stable. For my laptop needs I'll take Chrome OS over Windows any day.",4
"This MacBook is honestly very good and I’m impressed. It’s in great condition but it did come dirty and I just cleaned it and everything is fine. I do have concerns about the battery life, maybe it’s because of the game I was playing or something but it went from 100% to 78% in less than 15 minutes. Another thing is the “i” key on the keyboard is a bit stuck and it types out twice like this “ii” but that really about it, everything else is great. This is my first MacBook and i was honestly scared of getting a cheap laptop because every time i did it couldn’t run the simple stuff that i wanted it to do. This MacBook can handle basic gaming like Roblox and Minecraft. It went through so smoothly. Another thing is when I’m searching the web and try to go to a website, it doesn’t pop up it’s like it’s loading but it’s not. It isn’t with all the websites i look up but it’s with just some of them. Overall a great laptop I recommend!Edit: I think I’m going to bring this rating to a 4. Firstly, I forgot to mention the sound quality, it’s amazing honestly I can have the volume up about three to four notches and it dang near sounds like I’m in a movie theater, but the thing is I’m bringing this down to a 4 because this laptop is pretty old and doesn’t support a lot of things like I can’t even watch Netflix from off this laptop and I don’t even know how to access so many things on here. The App Store is stupid I’m trying to look up how to navigate everything because maybe that’s my problem but I don’t even know what year this thing is let alone know how to find out the year so it’s hard because if I just look up “MacBook Pro” YouTube thinks I’m talking about one of the newer ones. Like I said before this is a pretty good laptop but it’s so outdated and I can barely get any games on here. Like I got steam the other day but steam barely even have fun games that supports macOS. (Just in case anybody wanted to know about downloading steam). This is my review on this laptop.",4
"I've had a pen mouse for years and love them. Recently had to get a new one as I broke my old one. Decided to try this model and it works great. A little caution, though, the left click button can come off if it's dropped so be careful, though it is easy to put back on.",4
"Bought this after Logitech MS Ergo crapped out after 2 years so I can only really compare to the.The cheaper price was nice. The 3rd device is a handy option if you need it. The ball movement isn't as smooth but not far enough off to be much of a factor. The covering is slippery, sometimes I feel like it's going to slip away, the Logitech had actual grip to it. Battery life is about half. Often lags when switching between devices. The plastic base has me afraid I might accidentally snap, feels half as sturdy as the Logitech.Works well enough for the price, though if this craps out in the same amount of time as the Logitech then I'll probably shell out the little extra for the MX.",4
"It’s bigger the mini, but still smaller then regular mouse.I was looking for retractable core mouse in regular size, but most of selling in line is mini mouse. This is the biggest so far I can find on Amazon",4
"Works great, battery life is very good. Certainly not the quality of my aluminum Mac keyboard ... but it's backlit which is what I needed.",4
"The media could not be loaded. The keyboard hardware is very well built, while it is made of plastic, the artificial weights inside it makes it feel premium. I also think the keypresses has a more premium feeling compared to Apple's keyboard. However, they put many software hacks on this keyboard to try to achieve the function row functionality, which causes the following problems:1. Pressing F5 does not start dictation, instead it brings up Spotlight, it is same as pressing F4 button.2. F6 key does not start Do Not Disturb on Mac, instead it puts Mac to sleep.3. The Fn key is not sending the Fn key event. I have the Fn key set to bring up Emoji panel, but pressing it only changes the input method for me.4. Pressing fn + F1, F2…etc does not input F1 F2..etc key press, instead it is still performing multimedia functions such as brightness & volume.Details of the software hacks of this keyboard:The Fn button is not sending the Fn key event, so I can't use the Fn key to bring up the emoji panel, instead it is sending a hardcoded Control + Space keypress event to switch input methods. Same for F3 and F4 keys, they sending hardcoded keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Command + Space) to bring up Spotlight or Mission Control, if you customized the keyboard shortcuts in MacOS, some of the function row keys will no longer work. Since the Fn key is programmed to send Control + Space keypresses, you can not input F1 to F12 by pressing Fn + the function row keys, so if you need to input F1 to F12, then you have to look for other keyboards.I really hope they can fix the software on this keyboard, I have one docking station and 2 MacBooks, I bought this keyboard so that I can use the 2.4Ghz adapter to connect this keyboard to my docking station, so I don't have to switch keyboards when switching between my 2 MacBooks on my docking station.Upon reaching out to the seller about the problems above, the seller is very apologetic and offered a refund, huge kudos to the excellent customer service!",4
The media could not be loaded. I like the keyboard. Travel distance is pretty short but it still gives a little mechanical keyboard vibe.,4
"I order this keyboard, but a bigger keyboard and a $100 logitech keyboard. This is smaller than I thought it would be, but that isn't really bad. Yes, it would be a little easier if there was a row of buttons for the shortcuts instead of requiring everything to be a combo or triple combo press. But, it works good, the keys have a nice feel, it is easy to type on and the keys are where you expect them to be. You can turn the light brightness up and down. Plus, it has fn-lock, and an fn-lock indicator light, so you can pick whether the shortcut keys (most the F1-F12 keys) act like function keys when pressed or the shortcut keys. It comes with a manual but the instructions are also printed on the bottom of the keyboard which is a nice touch. It's very similar to a laptop keyboard. But yeah, apart from it being a little finicky when you go to pair it the first time, it's a really great keyboard. I almost never use the number pad numbers, and if I did need them for some reason, like I was playing a game, I could just switch to a different keyboard. I really don't see how a Logitech keyboard can be worth 2 1/2 times the price of this one. Granted, the Logitech comes with a dongle and this doesn't so maybe that will be an issues, but you can get a Bluetooth receiver for $10. The Logitech keyboard also comes with special software that will let you map the short keys to different keystrokes in different applications, but most applications already support shortcut key mapping, and Open Source programs like AutoHotKey and TweakKey for windows also allow you to do this for free will 100% for more more and flexibility. But yeah, I'm super happy, can't really speak on the battery life, but hopefully it is good.UPDATE 5/26/24:I didn't notice when I bought the keyboard or even when I reviewed it, but this keyboard comes with Left and Right Windows keys and No Left Ctrl. You have left and right Alt keys, but not left and right control, and a Right Windows. This makes it hard to use Photoshop and Illustrator on Windows because Ctrl++ and Ctrl+- are the default commands for zoom in and out, and if you have to use the left Ctrl key it suddenly requires 2 hands.Thankfully, there are a couple solutions. The easiest is to download Microsoft's PowerToys for Windows and go to the keyboard manager and Enable Key Remapping and then remap that key to Ctrl(left). This I have working.UPDATE:You can use a program called KeyTweak to remap keys in the Windows 10 Registry. I ended up having to do this because the keyboard doesn't have a delete and backspace button. The delete button typically works as a backspace button. You can press fn+delete to have it work as a delete button, but I need an actual delete button like my laptop keyboard has. This is the layout the Logitech MX mini uses (it costs almost $100 though).I used a program called KeyTweak to remap the PrntScreen key to delete in the Windows registry. Unfortunately, this remaps BOTH the print screen key on this keyboard, and the print screen key on my laptop.So, I have to unmap everything. Restart my computer, then map fn+PrintScreen (my laptop's ""Insert key"") to PrintScreen. Then map PrintScreen to delete. Then remap Left Windows Key to Left Control. And now it works the way I want, except I have to press fn when I press PrintScreen on my laptop, and I no longer have an Insert key, but I literally haven't used an insert key in probably 20 years.The reason I dropped my review to 4 stars is because the wireless keyboard seems to sometimes send double keys, or it will go to sleep (even when plugged in), and then it will miss a key, and then I'll hit it again, and then it will double send the key it missed + the new key. It's literally 6 inches from my laptop, and I wanted to see if I shut off bluetooth and just used USB-C if it would still mess up, but you can't shut off bluetooth and just plug it in :( So I'm dropping my review to 4 stars, mostly for the buggy keys but also because it lacks the option to work as a non-wireless keyboard. If it just worked good, I wouldn't mind having to rebind the keys, but missing keys and losing keys while typing it a big PITA, especially because I code. It isn't mess up enough to really warrant sending it back, it's maybe like 1 in 1000 keystrokes it messes up -- if it was any less I'd probably just think it was user error, but I've been typing a very long time and I can tell when I type something correctly and the keyboard tosses in an extra letter. Even just typing this sentence, it added an extra c in correctly and an extra s at the end of this and I had to go back and fix them.",4
"I generally like this keyboard for its size and weight (it's sturdy enough, but not as sturdy as an Apple keyboard). In my pics you can see it's fairly thin and it features backlighting, if you want that (you can turn it off).I prefer a wired keyboard due to better response time and avoiding connection or battery issues, so I got this one. Overall I'm OK with it, but the keys are a bit too sensitive and have weak spring stiffness to them. During rapid typing, you can easily overtype a key and I find myself frequently hitting delete to edit typing errors that don't happen on my Apple keyboard at home. For this review I'm using my Apple keyboard and I've managed to avoid having to delete extra letters. If I was using the Satechi keyboard, I would've had to hit delete maybe 10 times by now. It can get annoying, but it's not a complete make or break sort of thing.After 7 months of use, my keyboard has a little fading on heavy use keys, but it's not glaring and you can't really tell in my pics. I like that the keys are black so I can avoid the nasty dirtied up look white keyboards easily get.",4
"There are a lot of reviews saying it ""Wont hold a charge right off the bat"" or ""Won't Pair"". I thought I had the same problem, but found that it is supposed to display those things before setup. Magnets hold it closed, keys press alright, but the hinges are flimsy.Over all it works and I'm happy I can do homework on the go.",4
"Works well, no complaints in the function. Wish it had a cross referenced manual that translated to all the keys and their functions. I just ""hunt and peck"" because i dont know nor can figure out the extra keys",4
I had reported that the s key got stuck but after slapping it on the desk it popped back up. after doing this several times it is ok. maybe something got stuck under it. the keyboard is small and light,4
"I ordered the Tibuta Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard to use with my new T-mobile Revvl 10 inch 5G tabletIt connected really quick and easy by bluetooth, and all I can say is that it worked and I no longer have to type on that small on screen keyboard anymore. I knocked off 1 star from it's rating because it did not include a type USB-C cable, But I also had about a dozen of them in my desk drawer so that was not an issue for me, Now I would recommend this mini bluetooth keyboard to anyone looking for a nice keyboard, for their phones, tablets, and ipads...",4
"Bought this for my MacBook Pro. Connecting the 2 was no problem at all. I find myself having to continuously check what I just typed as it often times doest register the letter I just hit, which after a litle bit gets annoying. It is very light weight and compact. The price is nice but with the keys often times not registering on the screen, its a real. I think your better off spending the money on a better keyboard.",4
"Working properly, medium Quality Materials, 10” size . I Like it so much making using microsoft word , excel & power point on my ipad very easy",4
"Keyboard is satisfying and responsive, touchpad registers as a mouse (doesn't mess with a laptop's 'integrated' touchpad for example), and connectivity is good. Keyboard area is a little smaller to accommodate the touchpad, but it doesn't feel cramped. The touchpad is not responsive enough though, it doesn't seem well-configured to be honest. It's good!! Just not great yet. But overall, if this does what you need, it will definitely be a good choice :)",4
"Works great, like the soft keys and ergonomic design. Two issues for me, but it's just my personal opinion :-)1) No CTRL key on the right side of the keyboard. I use CTRL-Y often and not having the CTRL on the same side as the Y makes it a 2-handed move, not 1-hand.2) The Delete button is right next to the Bluetooth button. I'm constantly accidently clicking the 2.4G Bluetooth button and disconnecting the keyboard. Wish there wasn't a button right next to Delete, woudl be easier to ""find"" without looking.Again, other than those two little things, it works great.",4
"I purchased two different USB keyboards to try out, and found myself absolutely loving this little foldout. The design on this is brilliant, keyboard layout is natural and just large enough to allow for comfortable, rapid typing. It's attractive, even cute with an almost toy-like feel. It works well and connectivity is simple and assured.Wishlist: It is plastic and not aluminum as listed. I would pay more for something built a bit more ruggedly with metal case and hinges. I like it enough to care. The foldout phone shelf: great idea! I wish it were deep enough to accommodate my phone in its case. I purchased a phone holder separately as a result.Overall, the design is brilliant and the keyboard is very functional. I like it so much, I would love to see the product produced with long-term use in mind. I will be using this all of the time.",4
"Works well, but keys are small and tightly spaced. Best for slow, hunt-and-peck typists, people with quite small hands, slow typists with small hands, and children, especially children whose parents want to encourage them to reduce their screen time. This keyboard will do it.",4
"Pairs easilyInexpensive split keyboardKeeps wires downKeys stick a bit- hopefully more use will help that, it's a bit frustratingMy 5x more expensive version is flawless but again inexpensive choice that works",4
"It’s a good product and does what it’s designed for. I feel less pressure on my wrists but it will take some time to get a hang of it, it’s a bit hard to type initially.I also did not received batteries inside but my friend did.",4
"There are times that I have to check the connection because I cannot type anything on my screen. Nice padded wrist rest, and quiet keys.",4
"Easy set up, on & off button with place for USB so great for travelling between offices. Feels a bit cheaper than other models of similar price.",4
"I bought this to add to a ham radio (project) that I am in the process of developing. The project is based on a Raspberry Pi 4 computer so it has Bluetooth built in which had this item up & running fast. One thing that really bothered me is the so-called instruction sheet. It leaves a lot to beg and of course covered a multitude of languages that I will never use ...One point of contention I have so far is that I cannot find a way to hold down a key and then scroll down the screen. Yes I have a touch screen but its crammed by the programming of the radio so having a way to hold down a key or pad and then use the touch pad to scroll down the page would be nice....it may well be there but I haven't found it yet in the instruction sheet (too small for my old eyes to read comfortably) ... the case is plastic and my concern is that this radio is going to be used in the field and I have to wonder how well it will hold up there .... if it were made say in titanium or aluminum that would enhance its ruggedness in a filed application.On the good side it is amazinly easy to use, very good size for my needs, and has a really great touch feel for use. The compnay was very fast to ship and I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a nice portable keyboard with a number pad system ... I'm very happy with the unit.",4
"the keyboard buttons dont work so good for me they are pretty good i just dont feel that they are so fun to click isnt as satisfying as my old keyboard. the mouse works incredibly well amazing comfortable to move around, doesnt lag at all.",4
Easy to assemble. Working well. Nice sounding unit. LED lights very bright....almost strobe-like. Needed to move it from its original location as it was almost blinding to look at.....,4
I placed one in my office and it is a great conversation starter between new clients and I. I love the gentle sound of the water and the colors. I have 2 and the screen came apart from both but this is a minor issue. Simple & nice.,4
"I read many reviews before deciding to buy. Several mentioned that it splashed a lot. I almost didn't buy it because of that. But some of those who said that used a rock or pebble to assist with the flow and prevent splashing. Okay, potential problem solved. Several others mentioned that the pump was loud. Again, I considered not buying. But then I read responses that said to make sure the pump is completely submerged. Okay, another potential problem solved. I didn't find any other issues mentioned (other than the water tasting bad, but I'm not buying it to drink or for an animal to drink so....) so I decided to buy it. It's lovely! It produces a wonderful visual effect. My pump speed is at the highest and it trickles nicely. Doesn't splash at all. The pump makes a light hum, but it's not annoying. It is fully submerged. It shipped quickly and was easy to set up. My only disappointment is that it does not produce sound of water I was hoping for.",4
"Very pretty. Expected a little larger. Should have paid more attention to the measurement details. However keeping it. Added decorative pebbles in greys, browns and blacks. Looks wonderful and this fountain is nice and quiet!",4
"Beautiful piece sits nicely on my entry table. I am enjoying the sound of the waterfall in the house. Downfalls: I had to modify the mesh insert to make the sound pleasing to the ears; the water velocity switch really does not work...it only works on full force which impacts the sound of the water. the low does not pull the water through the pump; there is no on off switch, you must unplug it if you want it to stop. Overall, the piece is beautiful and relaxing, but there was manipulation involved to get it to work as desired.",4
"Purchased: for daughter who for some reason has been wanting a waterfall forever -Pros: Light sound is nice, takes up a smaller amount of space, easy assembly.Cons: Smaller than anticipated, do have to provide water a lot especially if using a good amount of the day. Not sure if worth $22.00 price (recently reduced) more realistic around $15",4
It’s a very nice fountain for the price. It’s quiet and pretty and very attractive. I would only use distilled water in it so that is an additional cost. Mine just died. The pump no longer works and it lasted about 16 months just in case anybody wants to know. I don’t think that’s too bad.,4
"I love this elephant fountain that my fiancé bought me, but when I found out how much he paid I thought it was way too much for what it is. The fountain is small and turns on and off only by plugging it in. There is no power switch.",4
"Really cute, well working fountain with great water sound. Love how the elephant is watering herself & baby!",4
"I like the aesthetics of the buddha hand waterfall but it's too quiet for me you can't hear the water falling. Unfortunately, I may be sending it back because it's not serving my purpose for buying.Ok, as I was dissembling the fountain to return it I noticed a small lever on the side of the motor so I adjusted the lever and turn the fountain back on and the water flow increased and I could hear the sound of water more than before so I will not be returning it after all. I love it now!",4
"The media could not be loaded. I love this fountain! It’s quiet enough that it doesn’t disturb me. It’s very relaxing to listen to! I love the glow of the lights at night. My cats apparently love it too, so I had the buy them their own fountain! The only comment I would make is that it looks more brown than grey in person.",4
Love this fountain! So relaxing to listen to and very pretty to watch in the evenings.Disappointed in the company for not following through with my return of the 2nd fountain (not working properly). I’m hoping they will get back to me and fix this issue. I will change my review once everything is resolved.I had no issues with the first fountain.,4
Love this product just enough ambient light to be pleasant and not harsh. Now if I can figure out how to keep it from splashing all over the table. Any suggestions?,4
"I should have read the specs more carefully instead of relying on pictures. It's really small. But if this is the size you want, then it's great. The rocks are loose and you arrange them yourself. Setup takes about a minute. The light is only visible at night. It goes through water fairly quickly, so we usually pour the last of our water bottles into it every day.",4

Silent motor but little water sounds. Looks cool for the price.,4
"This is very cute. Quality seems to be good and it runs perfectly....but you need to fill water almost daily so that's a bummer but it might be because of the size of the fountain. Very pretty, running water sound is nice and it does exactly what it's supposed to do I kept it and use it",4
"I loved this little fountain, you can hear the sound and it's cute. I only found out about using distilled water. This is black, so even with filtered water it's stained white where the water splashes. Then the pump stopped, I cleaned it (wasn't really dirty) but still didn't work. The plastic tube that attaches things together is useless. It does splash.",4
It's small but gives off good sound. You literally have to add water every other day though.,4
"I've had this fountain for about 8 days now. First - as reported - the bowls/pots are made out of some kind of porcelain or clay and the fountain is heavy.Assembly is a snap. The top two bowls are a single piece with a molded stem that fits into the 3rd bowl; and then the 3rd bowl has a molded stem that fits into the bottom bowl. The water hose from the pump to the top bowl is fed through the same stems. Another poster reported that the mounting was flimsy, but I disagree. Actually the stems are very sturdy - to the point to where the bowls will only fit in the one position as shown, and have absolutely no wobble.The sound of the water trickling is the best (loudest) of any table fountain that I've owned, which I expected with the large bottom bowl of water for the water to fall into. As others have mentioned, you don't hear the pump running at all.I was a bit concerned about the water level in the 3rd-from-top bowl. There's a rim around the bowl, but the water comes up to within 1/8-1/16 of an inch from the top of the rim. If someone were to knock the table where the fountain sits hard enough, I would expect some water to spill out of that bowl. This is true regardless of the pump water-flow setting (I tried all 3).My biggest issue with the fountain is that there is some splash. As shown, the bottom bowl is a big bowl full of water. I've tried various water levels from almost full to not even covering the top of the pump as well as adjusting the water flow setting, but regardless, there is a small amount of splash - with droplets of water appearing on the side of the bottom bowl and some slight specks of water collecting on the table below the fountain. After 10-12 hours of running, there's enough mist/droplets on the table to have to wipe them off. On a glass or well-protected surface, not a problem, but I wouldn't put this on a wood surface. I've also tried tilting the fountain a bit (being careful of the water close to the rim of the 3rd bowl), but I can't figure out how to get rid of the slight splash. If it weren't for the slight splash, I'd easily rate this fountain at 5 stars.",4
"I really love this little fountain I bought another one around the same time I purchased this one it was much smaller and much cheaper and the smaller and cheaper one works a little bit better only concerning the fact that this one runs out of water rather quickly I have to refill it at least once a day or every two days while the little one sustains for a few days that's my only complaint other than that I love both of my fountains and I would purchase again, maybe not for $30 though, considering. And also the background mirror gets really dirty and it's hard to clean👍",4
"This fountain looks great, but I had to do so much just to get it to a place I was happy with. Obviously the pump has to be completely submerged in water to avoid the loud humming, which I did. Despite the water level, it was still extremely noisy, and I couldn't figure out why...After disassembling it completely and just having the pump plugged in by itself, I discovered that the source of the noise was coming from the pump vibrating against the base of the reservoir. Since there was no possible way to adjust the way the pump was positioned in the water, I had to resort to a very weird solution....I grabbed some pipe cleaners, shaped them into a circular fashion, and stuck them at the bottom of the fountain to make a make-shift bed to rest the pump on while it was submerged in the water, and it surprisingly worked like a charm. No more noise.Also the ""rocks"" that this fount comes with are absolutely pathetic. I happened to have a bag of black stones that I use for another fountain in my house that worked will for this one too.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I wish there were some instructions so I didn’t fumble about trying to figure out where the circle of lights attached to the battery go (I shoved it around the tube that carries the water up, I think it’s right but who knows). The shipping took about 1 month I ordered September 21st and got it October 17th so not bad since it was drop shipped from china. The left wing came broken off but I super glued it so no big you can’t even tell. It was decently packaged. The entire fountain is made out of a plastic/acrylic so pretty light weight but reasonable for the price.",4
This fountain is adorable but you can barely hear the water trickling.,4
I love that you actually hear the water over top of the pump. It sounds very nice and the little LED lights were a bonus.,4
Set up was tricky. Hard to set cord in fountain hole and controls are on cord. It is beautiful and relaxing.,4
Good functionality.,4
The media could not be loaded. Well usually the pumps are too weak mine is in good shape and I'm having a little problem with keeping the water from splattering out of the dish. Any ideas I would appreciate.,4
"This fountain is a nice compact tabletop size.It requires assembly. The instructions say to add vinegar to the water, clean weekly & add water daily. This requires more upkeep than expected.The flowers, stems & petals must be installed on the lid, which tips easily. Every time I remove the lid for maintenance, I have to fix all the flower portions again.It’s cute, adds moisture to the room and sounds nice.",4
"Changes colors & soothing sound of waterfall. Very light sound. It's a bit difficult to put together, but finally got it going!!",4
"The media could not be loaded. I like it j, I ust got it today no colour change lighting just one light. Luckily I have a colour changing la.o beside it to compensate.",4
"I received this today. Very easy to assemble. Quality product, the water started flowing right away and is not noisey. The reason for 4 stars is because online the candle pullars look gold, I was expecting gold, but they are brown. Even with the candles glowing they still look brown, not the gold I was hoping for.Am keeping it because it is lovely and adds a wonderful ambence",4
"The media could not be loaded. If you’re just wanting this for aesthetics to look at, I think it’s a good buy, but if you’re using this for maybe a sleep sounds, it is not a goodbye. You have to be very close to it to hear the water running.",4
My dad sprayed it with rum and it seems to be doing better,4
"Easy enough to install and set up. The water falls quite a distance so it's loud, not a soft trickle of water. But pretty. The lights and actually distracting and their cable/cord isn't with the water so it gets wet and corroded on first use.",4
It could of came with directions but I went to the pictures on my order and figured it out. I wasn't sure how much water to put but it needs to touch the wheel I seen. It isn't as quiet as I thought either. Over all I give it a 3. It does work and its very cute. My son loved it. I put it in his room and its looks very kid like. He loves the light and how it spins.,4
"The media could not be loaded. I bought this for my office to add some serenity for clients. Water is at full line and the motor is loud and obnoxious. I hate doing returns on Amazon it’s so inconvenient but this thing is going to have to go back. What a waste of my time. You can barely even hear the water. Cute tho for whatever that’s worth.UPDATE: So I turned it on again and it sounds fine. There’s a very mild pump noise but the water is the stronger sound now. I have no idea what changed. Not upping to full five stars though as it’s been an annoying experience. It’s a pretty decent water feature now, in any case. Yay for procrastination.",4
"It's served me well over the months I've had this thing. I keep it right by my bed, on my bedside desk. It's very relaxing to listen to, and fun to run your fingers through, which is the most important bit as we all know.I've read some reviews that said it was loud or made a noise. Never happened to me unless the water got too low. I'm 90% sure most of the reviews that complain about this consist of people who forgot evaporation was a thing that happens.It is understandable though, it's small, so doesn't take a ton of water for it to go from the fill line (which is kinda hard to see/find) to a bit too low and you can start to hear the difference; if you were to keep it going 24/7 I'd imagine you'd need to add water to it every 12-ish hours or so to keep 'er healthy.One complaint I do have about it is the little light that they have shining on the sail: it's a bit too bright for night yet too dim for a lit room. It's also non-negotably a part of it. You can't dim it, or turn it off while the water is going, or change the color, etc. If it's on, it's got that orange light shining at it. If you had planned on having this by your bed like me, you either have to get used to the light and be sure it's pointed away from you, or just not have it on going to sleep at all. I eventually settled on the latter.Also, the cable is a bit too short for me, just 1 or 2 more feet would've been perfect. It seems designed to go on a table or something positioned right in front of/ directly above a outlet, but the place I wanted to put it is about half a desk length away, so the cable currently is pulled all the way taught in order for it to just barely reach. The on/off switch being on the cable itself makes this problem especially cumbersome.TLDR:• I like it a lot, especially for the price.• It needs refilling due to evaporation• Point above likely contributes most to the 'noise' complaints you may read about.• Light on it is unadjustable in its brightness, color, on/off state, etc. Kinda annoying.• The cable isn't very long, and the on/off switch is on the cable itself, so it must be close to an outlet with a length of the cable itself exposed and reachable.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I love the look and functionality of this fountain but it’s too loud for regular bedroom or office. The motor is super quiet unless the later level is too low ( top off water 1x to 2x a day to prevent noise and future damage) It also has slight splashing that add up over time , which may damage future . Iv tried everything to fix the noise and splashing of the water and the only thing thats works it’s cutting a sponge and placing it on the vertical rocks that stick out. I ordered September of 2023 and it still works great (1 year later). my sponge method works perfectly. { size- small and perfect, value for money- yes , calming- yes but after I added a sponge. 9 out of 10",4
"Easy set up and works good, and looks good,have it set on medium,very relaxing.",4
This is such a beautiful fountain. The trickling water is perfect. However I hate that I have to keep refilling it everyday. You could fill it up in the morning and but 5pm it needs water again,4
"The fountain looks beautiful especially during the night where you can see the spinning ball with different colors. The major detraction is their warranty. It isn't stated on this product page, but when you contact the seller, they will let you know it's 3 months. Product is subpar because my pump only lasts a little over 6 months. I'm giving it 4 stars since seller was willing to find a solution for me to replace my pump. I wish the warranty was longer like most products (usually 1 year).",4
This is so pretty in our sunroom. It does make a noise when the water gets low. Haven’t had any other problems.,4
The media could not be loaded. I spied one of these in a darkened office at the gym where I work out and just fell in love with it. I search here on Amazon until I found the exact same one. Everyone in my office is jealous; coworkers who sit near my cubicle love the gentle trickling sound of the water. It is a nice addition to my office space and offers a little bit of Zen to hectic workdays.,4
"Idk why but it had filtered water, and the motor suddenly stopped working. I have had it for a few months. It was such a lovely fountain. I love it and recommended my friends who came over. I love the splash and the bells. The rocks were a nice touch. I don’t know wether to replace it with a new one, I am a little bit worried but willing to think about it",4
"Lovely fountain I bought as a gift for my husband for Christmas. He has always wanted a fountain and loves the sound of the water. It was slightly smaller than I realized but not an issue. It was set up easily and works great, the amount of rocks included could have been better but again it's not really issue. Husband has figured out the settings he likes and is greatly enjoying the soothing sounds of water and I like the soft glow of the lights. No complaints here!",4
"This little fountain is just as advertised - pump gives a light hum, but with a pad beneath, it is hardly notable. The pleasant-looking statue holds a small but adequate light in its palm. The water barely ripples, has a nice trickling sound, very gentle.",4
"It has a more plastic-y look than the picture and there is not enough rocks to hide all around the Buddha but those are easy to find in dollar stores, so I'll find more. Also, there is no on-off switch. You just plug it and inplug it to turn it on and off. Considering it's electricity and water, I don't really like that. I plugged it in a power bar. It also makes the cable almost impossible to hide since you need to always be able to access it to turn it on and off. Besides that it's cute and very quiet.",4
Beautiful with a positive message but water is silent flow. The rocks were dirty and soiled my new white lace dolly that I purchased to display the fountain on. Nope it washes clean.,4
Small fountain but fits great on a small table. It is very quiet and does not splash water.,4
"One of the little fountains came with a tiny hole that allowed water to seep out and run down the side, covering my desk in water. Luckily I caught it before it damaged anything and sealed it with some silicone. The motor is silent, which is a big plus.",4
The fake vegetation kept falling off so had to glue it.Usually relaxing when in use.,4
Perfect size and the water sounds along with lights makes it soothing for late evenings. Helps to relax faster and sleep longer.,4
"The media could not be loaded. I think this is a nice value and a pretty fountain. I did add a few stones to the bottom chamber so that I could hear the water a little bit better. Otherwise you can’t hear the water very well. Overall, I am happy!",4
"Liked the look of this desktop fountain and it runs well. However not currently able to use it as it is too loud for my studio space due to the design and water drop back into the pool. I'm in a 12 x 12 room, albeit with a lot of hard surfaces (floors, walls, desks) so the water sound quickly moves from soothing trickle noises to reverberating distraction. To spin the ball the pump has to be on the second highest setting only. Anything less and the ball stalls or only vibrates, high speed, the water shoots off the back of the ball and on to desk and floor. It looks nice in our decor, so I kept it and have the LEDs lighting the ball without the pump and may rig it in the future as an atomizer to create a fog illusion in the centre design. It just doesn't work as intended in my office space - may be great in a different setup and if the limitations of my environment are removed, it's worth the 4-stars. Disappointed I can't use it in my space and so not advised for a smaller quiet office area or where lots of impromptu Zoom or Teams meetings are frequent unless you can unplug it easily / quickly. Sounds to remote users like you're in the bathroom, LOL!",4
"I purchased these as it hit my two main criteria for work office decor, it was cheap and not terribly tacky.I wanted a quiet sound of running water in my office, the noise helps me focus. I was disheartened initially as it was nearly silent, and by nearly I mean it didn't even so much as produce sound other than the hum of the pump. I noticed upon assembly that it hard some sort of black plastic restrictor inside the hose that runs from the pump to the top bowl. I used a tool to remove this restrictor and that massively improved the flow. It now generates a delightful trickle!Not featured in the listing are the included small pebbles and glass marble ball thing. The instructions make no mention of placement for the marble in the feature, it only fits in the top ball. I assume it is to create the effect of the ball spinning or bobbing. However, it is far too heavy an merely acts as yet another restriction for flow. This is OK as with the pump turned to full with the restrictor removed it is a little aggressive, but slower speeds lead the pump to more hum.All in all, it balances itself out nicely. It produces the sound I was looking for and the design isn't terribly obtrusive.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I like this little tabletop fountain and have it underneath our gazebo. It's a great addition to our morning coffee routine.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND removing the small black restrictor from the hose, (I pushed it out with a chopstick). This will give you better water flow.Also, watch your water levels. Too much and the unit goes quiet. Too little and it sucks like a small pool filter.You can find the sweet spot with a little adjusting of the rocks and turning the bowls.It's a nice calming accent for the price!",4
"I really enjoy how the fountain looks! It adds a tranquil feel to the room. It is a great size; not too big, not too small. I would have liked it to have a water trickling/flowing noise, but it does not. If you remove the floating ball, you can hear the water sound, although it may splash water without it. I also would have liked the base to have a notch for the cord as the top doesn't sit quite flush with the base because of the cord. Overall, very nice fountain. Adding additional rocks (purchased separately) adds to the appeal.",4
"The fountain is exactly what I wanted for my home office. It’s fairly sturdy and eye-pleasing for the price-point. The set up was easy and the LED light gives it a nice glow. I agree with other posts that it doesn’t make much sound, but I fixed that issue by placing a few small stones on each leaf at the spout. Theadditional stones created a little more water pooling on each leaf, creating that classic trickling water sound.",4
"I can work with mine, but check your measurements, tho. They are small.",4
Decoration,4
"The media could not be loaded. It's a really nice little tabletop fountain, but it is so quiet, it has no water sounds! The motor sounds louder in the video, but really it's so quiet. Directions say to put something underneath it to quiet the motor, but it really doesn't bother me at all. I barely hear it. My only issue is: I don't hear water trickles at all. I was looking forward to that!",4
it was good while it lasted.,4
This is a very beautiful and decorative mister. Putting it together was a bit difficult as there were no instructions. A little pricey too. But very nice.,4
"Perfect size for my bathroom, but the plastic does feel really cheap. It is very light. But it does work",4
"The instructions show a pump with an adjustable flow rate. Mine came without a flow rate switch, so I can't adjust the flow. Because of the discrepancy, I did not give 5 stars.I like the amount of water regardless of not being able to adjust the flow, and it produces a nice sound for a 12X15 room. The rim is damp in the bottom/main basin, but after 8 hours of running, there was no over splash. On the shelf or the floor.The material is fairly heavy and it seems to be a nice color/quality. It fits in with the room colors and plants at my desk.It was mostly assembled. All I had to do was un pack, connect light connector, fill with water and plug it in.Very minimal. It is a tight squeeze getting the pump in and out with your hand and I had to use a pen to get the pump placed and pull the pump out by the cord. My hand would not fit in side. I can't reach an octave on a piano, but my hand muscles are fairly developed.The lights are better in pictures, but it is really nice.",4
"I only gave 4 stars because there were so many reports of damaged items upon delivery and mine was one of them. Luckily, Amazon's procedure of reporting, quick response and fairly easy returns allowed me to get a replacement in 2 days. I love my little water feature. I DO wish the ""tinkling"" were a bit louder as I have it in my office for relaxation, but I'm glad it doesn't splash. I also have the ability to have my Google home add the sound of a babbling brook if I feel the need. I like the spinning and colorful orb and I'm looking forward to the evening to see it in the dark.",4
"Nice product, really beautiful. Product as described.",4
"If you are intending to get this fountain to create the sound of moving water, you will need it within 5 feet of your head to hear it. I hoped with this many stages of falling water, it would be loud enough to put it in my office or bedroom, to drown out some ambient noises. However, it's more of a decorative piece than an ambient sound machine.It definitely looks cool, but I was hoping it would create a lot more sound. In the description it does say ""quiet"" water sound, so I can't complain too much. Overall, it's a good fountain, easy to assemble and use. Just fill the bottom of the unit up until it's 60-75% full (in the outer, bottom bowl). I'll probably end up returning it myself, just because I don't care how it looks. I wanted a louder fountain, I suppose I could mod this one to make it louder.",4
I really liked this but I live in an urban area and the sound of the trickling water was lost under the traffic noise.,4
"As I find happening more and more these days, products that arrive work exactly how they should but due to instructions that lack proper detail the setup is often frustrating and may even dishearten you enough to return it. The customer can even find themselves thinking they have a faulty product when in reality the instructions skipped over something that could solve the problem. Some times you may feel a little ""stupid"" when you realize where you messed up but let's just assume that you have no idea how ANYTHING works. So here are the few things that, if you have never owned a fountain before and have precisely no idea what to expect (which is what instruction manual writers should always be assuming when considering wording, what explanations should be included, and visual aid. Think of that instructions giving exercise you might have done in school during which you give step by step DETAILED instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.), this is what you need to know.First. Have several towels ready. Put one down, put the fountain on top of it and be prepared to switch them out. Put a bowl of water under the table you have the fountain it on if you have to. After I write this I will be blow drying the carpet.In regards to the following steps.3. Check that the pump is firmly connected to the water tubing that is built into the fountain and the pump is sitting flat on the bottom of the reservoir.A bit of clarification: The pump and the water tubing are not actually connected already. However, because everything is packed in so tightly it gives the illusion that it may in fact be quite secure. There are warnings all over the place that if you damage the tubing your warranty is voided which gives the customer a sense of uncertainty about handling the pump at all. And of course you can't actually see anything in the reservoir so that isn't helpful. Also getting the pump to stay flat while the reservoir is dry is more trouble than it's worth so keep reading.Side note: There is a small grey slider on the pump that determines the strength of the flow. Make sure that is all the way on. Because it didn't seem to mark which way to slide it (there is a good possibility it is in fact marked however when I figured this part out the pump was inside the fountain already), keep this in mind for the bit of troubleshooting clarification at the end of this review.5. Fill the fountain with enough water to keep the pump fully submerged during operation, approximately 6 cups.Note: The image above the worded instructions shows the water being dumped into the bottom pool where the light is located. Don't do that. There is no way to truly feel or see if the pump is actually submerged. Get a funnel, make sure you have a good light source angled towards the back of the fountain (where the access panel door is meant to go once setup is complete. The panel should not yet be in place.) With the pump pushed in as far as possible but NOT holding it down, fill the reservoir, slowly, by pouring the water into the funnel first. Once the pump is submerged as much as it can be , remove the funnel, reach in and push it down gently, ensuring that the suction cups on the pump are properly secured. If the pump is now sticking out of the water, reinsert the funnel and add more water until the pump is submerged.Note on the note: At the bottom it states ""Note: When first plugged in, there may be air in the pump. It may take several moments for trapped air to escape, allowing water to flow.""When it says several moments, it means it. I'm not saying two or three seconds I'm saying give it a good thirty before deciding that the flow may not be strong enough.And on that note on the note, the troubleshooting I mentioned. If it seems that the water flow is terribly weak but it's clear that the water is not being backed up (the pool at the bottom isn't overflowing therefore proving that the problem is most likely not kinking or a break in the tube) reach back in and feel for the pump. Feel for that grey slider and push it in the opposite direction. The flow should immediately increase. This just means when you slid it over the first time you slid it in the wrong direction. If the flow DOES NOT increase, check again that the tubing is secured to the pump properly. Though I found once it was, it didn't slide off easily.About the visual aid.I can't even fully explain what is depicted in the little bubble next to the image of the fountain. There is a square pointing towards a line that has another square protruding from it and what looks like a chord dangling out of it? I couldn't tell you what that was supposed to signify other than don't have this thing plugged in when dealing with water. But it could also be referring to the light splitter which is used to, as I'm sure you've guessed, split the power so the pump gets the proper voltage and the light gets the proper voltage without needing two separate AD wall adapters. But because it isn't clear, that can put some doubt in your mind as to whether or not you're missing something.Concerning Troubleshooting SectionThere are an abundance of troubleshooting steps listed with this product. They are basically just for if the pump doesn't work at all. I mean it doesn't even turn on. There was almost nothing about if the product functions but not as expected. That is why I was fumbling around so much and figured out the little tip about the slider on the pump. A troubleshooting guide should essentially be worded like ""If this is happening make sure that this is secured/plugged in/properly positioned etc. Not the case here.In conclusion: The fountain is wonderful. It does exactly what is shown in the video in the description. It sounds great, looks great, and is extremely soothing. I would love to fill my house with these or even get a floor standing one just to have more of that atmosphere in every room, but alas I live in an apartment (with a landlord who, let's just say, deserves his own written review. I'll do that in the proper venue once I've moved out.) But the instructions are poorly written. As I said. All manuals should be done assuming the customer knows nothing. This may seem like a useless review to someone who had prior knowledge, but to those of us that literally have no idea, it will help you.",4
"So the product was great until it wasn't.. After a few months the pump had stopped to a trickle.. Before tossing the pump and ordering a new one, I gave it one last clean.. While doing that, I found, shoved up in the hose line, was a cut piece of it, to restrict flow (see pic).. My guess is after a year or so you figure the pump gave out and it's time to buy a new one.. Well it's not, I shoved a screw driver up there and got it out.. My fountain works like brand new again and I have a feeling itll stay working like new 🙃.. Im not gonna say, when it was new, MAYBE it needed the cut piece of tube to restrict the flow, so it wasn't to much, BUT it ended up ruining it almost.. Were gonna say it was a mistake hopefully, bc other then this issue, it's been doing what it's supposed to do and been very nice to have.. Thanks!",4
"The media could not be loaded. This is a very simple, yet elegant looking desk waterfall/fountain. It's also not exactly what I was looking for, before i really knew what i was looking for.It is extremely simple to put together (basin, pump, fountain base, water cups... and the decorative rocks and glass ball).However, when I assembled, filled, and ran it, I found two things that weren't to my liking:1. It was almost silent. I was expecting some amount of flowing water sound as soothing background noise but there was none. I tried removing the glass ball from the top cup to increase flow but everything is too close to the next recepticle to generate any noise. If you want visual aesthetic with no sound, this is your fountain.2. The ball doesn't spin much/at all. Other reviews recommend adding water but that is not a silver bullet. I tried filling it to almost overflowing and draining it to just enough to keep flowing, no spinny.So I tried some configuration changes to try and improve the glass ball visual aesthetic and provide some flowing water ambience. After a little trial and error, I came. up with the following, as shown in the pic and vid:- Remove the bottom (LED holding) cup. This allows the water to drop from the third cup straight into the water basin through the hole where the last cup should be.- Place the LED in the runoff hole of the fountain base in front of where the bottom cup goes.- Place the glass ball on top of the LED to help obscure the space where the last cup should be.- Lay the rocks around the fountain base, using 2-3 to help build up the 'wall' hiding where the water flows into the basin.This will not give you a spinning ball but it will light it up and provide some subtle background trickling water. You're welcome.I don't usually expect to have to hack something to suit my requirements but this fountain is elegant and cheap enough that I didn't mind.",4
The only issue i ever have with items like this and this one is it's only flaw is the fact that if it's not perfectly level it leaks. I added a plate under it to catch cause it was a very slow leak but then apparently the plate leveled it. I never understand why these things happen but otherwise works well and looks nice. My kids absolutely love it.,4
"UPDATE: A replacement showed up very quickly. Same packaging, but it was perfect.Very quiet motor. I forgot to look what setting it is on before turning it on. No splash. No water trickling sound, but it might be in low. (Mini update: turned switch on bottom, might have changed the water flow somewhat. However! I added a little stone or two to the top and now as the water runs around the stones I have a water fountain sound! Also, still no splash!)I planned on putting it on a table on the porch. Listing says indoor and outdoor many places. The directions clearly state indoor. It is only a two prong plug.Original review: The tail on the yellow bird was broken. It was shipped only in the privy manufacturer packaging. The box did not look harmed.Wondering if everything was just too tightly packed.The water reservoir was sitting directly on the top of the packaging on the bird. Any downward pressure probably broke it.It’s pretty. The yellow isn’t as bright but it almost looks more natural instead of lemon yellow. I liked it. Hopefully I’ll be able to plug the new one in and use it.",4
Cool little fountain but colors are maybe a bit drab. Otherwise it’s cute.,4
"I'm like 90% sure that the unit I received was used/returned because there were water marks on the pieces. I don't really care about that but thought I'd mention it. The gripes I have are that there is a hairline crack across the back side of it and there are some glue spots/flaws in the finish. I'm sure the crack can be sealed, and it's in the back so no one will really see it. The glue spots are likewise fixable.The fountain is easy to set up. You just attach the tube to the pump, set the pump volume with the little lever, pour in your water, place the top piece onto the bowl, press the pump to the bottom of the bowl so the suction cups stick, arrange your rocks, plug it in, and you're off to the races. The pump is quiet and easy to replace if necessary.It makes a nice setting for action figure photos (just don't leave them there or the water might damage them) and can be decorated adorably with colorful glass pieces/beads, non-water-soluble minerals (such as quartz or obsidian), or little glass or ceramic fish/frogs/turtles/birds/etc.Note: in my photos, I have the pump set on medium (the lever is right in the middle)",4
"The media could not be loaded. If you're looking for a small, minimalist tabletop fountain that is NOT plastic, this fits the bill. It's easy to set up - attach the pump and replace the dome. The water evaporates quickly; good for adding humidity in the room but it needs some attention. I add water every day, ~ 1/2 cup, when the pump starts gurgling. Otherwise it is silent when filled. I wanted more of a trickling noise, but not too much, so I added a small rock to the top. That breaks up the flow and makes a quiet trickle. (See video.) I also added more rocks to the bowl, which was larger than I expected.",4
It's quite good. I wish it has a on-off bouton. I have to always unplug it from the main switch. It's working quite nicely so far though.,4
I bought the original and loved it. This was supposed to be a replacement. It's not as graceful and I'm having trouble getting the sound of water.,4
"I really really like this little fountain. But the other reviews are right… It’s so small and so quiet that you won’t hear actual bubbling. So if you’re looking for that sound… This isn’t the fountain for you. Otherwise, It’s a great little fountain and every other wayEDIT: if you remove the small rocks from around the bubbler, this is a much more enjoyable sound and overall small fountain.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I gave 4 stars only because no instructions. I was about to return it because they have no instructions how to put it together. But I realized how to do it!!! Is affordable, beautiful center piece for any party!! A little noisy but you can’t hear it once you have music playing, lolLove it",4
"Read Jeff Thompson's review. He talks about how to set up the cords and silicone the opening to make sure you don't get leaks. It takes a little work, but once you get it set up correctly, it is really wonderful. I also agree with the buyer who said it pumps plenty of water at the lowest pump setting. I took their advice and I'm glad I did. It pumps quite a bit of water at the lowest setting. The lights are perfect, the sound of the water is amazing. I really like it. Here's a few tips: 1. Put it in a container in case it leaks. 2. You can fill the water from the front so seal the bottom part of the back opening with silicone (see picture). 3. The lowest point of the back opening is about 3.5 inches from the bottom. So if you fill the water from the front, get the level to where the water just covers the LED light in the lowest basin. That is about 3 inches from the bottom so it won't be overfilled and the water won't leak out the back. 4. Use a water treatment that is meant to stop bacterial growth and mold. I use one that is meant for swamp coolers and humidifiers. 5. Like others have suggested, use small rocks at the base of each waterfall to change the sound to fit your preference. 6. I took out the black screen on the second tier waterfall because I didn't like the way it looked. After I took it out, I didn't notice any difference in splashing or the flow of water, so I would recommend doing that. I just want to give another special shout-out to Jeff Thompson. I don't know you, but I'm very grateful for your idea on stopping the leaks! I took the time to write my suggestions because Jeff took the time to write his. Overall, after taking the time to get it set up right and making a decorative base for it, I absolutely love this waterfall! It's so relaxing and peaceful. I'm so glad I got it.",4
Very nice piece. Nice water sound and very little pump noise. I was happy with the purchase. It was a gift for my wife.,4
"The media could not be loaded. What I like: Appearance of better quality than it actually is, attractive, easy to put together, can't hear the motorWhat I don't like: The water stream is barely audible. Ambient noise will cancel the subtle sound. I had to build up the stones by placing a larger stone on each side of the smaller stones which helped. The stones help highlight the sound as the water trickles through them however, it's a very small water flow with limited space to build the stones up. After all, it's a small item. Best placed in a quiet space.",4
"I bought this for my wife to place next to her Orchids, thinking it would add a little moisture to the ambient air around them. I was very impressed with the quality, and the easy setup. It is important to note that you need to make sure the pump is completely submerged. Anyway, the LED's are awesome but why not put one in every tier?? There are 4 tiers but only 3 LED's. It just looks like it is missing that forth tier and seems like it could have been such an easy thing to include. This is the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5.I will fix that 4th tier by adding an LED to that location. There are many aftermarket parts to make that happen. Other than that, it's a wonderful table top feature that works great with a surrounding of plants.ADDITIONALLY: I am normally not happy with about 25% of my Amazon shipping experiences, but this time, I have to say that I am completely happy! I did not think I would get this until at LEAST 5 days later, yet it got to me in two days. THANK YOU! Expected Feb 17th, got Feb 12th!EDIT: I changed my review to 2 stars out of 5. Why? The pump croaked after less than 5 months of use. I figured it would die with continuous use in a year or two, but not after less than 5 months. We only used distilled water, used the water anti-algae drops weekly as-per instructions, and NEVER let it go dry. As a matter of fact, because of evaporation, I checked it every day to make sure it was full. So since it croaked, I decided to do to it what I wanted to anyway. Put an after-market pump in it, and redo the LED feature. After all, I was always irritated that not all the tiers were lit.EDIT 2ND: The customer service is very good. I had a response to my complaint email within one business day, and had a pump shipped and received within 4 business days free because of the warranty. Our feature is working great again, which is why I bumped the rating back to 4 stars.",4
"I love this for fountain for table tops, not too big or too small... Just right! Beautiful and well made looking sculpturing gives it a more realistic feel. The only issue I had is the pump is a bit too loud, which I resolved for the most part by adding some foam as sound barriers to both the inside bottom and outside bottom. I am sensitive to any noises, and wanted to focus on the soothing water sounds more than vibrations of the motor. They could easily redesign this with that added sound absorption, but either way it's worth the buy and brings good vibes into ur home!",4
"The video in the product details is extremely amplified compared to the sound it actually makes. It is a nice looking product, the motor is quiet, the water flows nicely and does not splash onto surrounding surface, but I really was looking for something to create a little more ‘white noise’ in a silent house. This does not provide that in my opinion.",4
I love it but there's no on/button. I have to plug it/unplug it.,4
"Lovely little item, truly.I don’t understand why people complain about the water noise or splashing, all you have to do is place pebbles where the water pours and then no more noise or splashing.Leave top bowl (level 3) alone.Leave middle bowl (level 2) alone, place one of the larger rocks where the water from this bowl hits the platform.Bottom bowl with light (Level 1), if you want to remove the sound where water from level 3 drops into the lighted level 1 bowl, place a rock leaning against the orange light in the bowl where the water from the level 3 bowl lands and that will stop the splashing sound.If you line up the pebbles against the edge of the platform you will also cut down any noise from the motor.You can top off the water by pouring it into the little hole in the back, where the power cord is supposed to come out of the water pump.... so you don’t have to remove the platform to do that. However, it is tedious to once a week clean the item. You have to remove the pebbles to fully clean it and then have to replace them when done. If you use clear not hard water, you can clean it every few weeks rather than once a week..NOTE: Make sure you run it hard during the first few weeks so if there is a pump problem, you can return it to amazon. I did wind up having a pump issue and THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS.",4
"The media could not be loaded. This is very cute and relaxing, I can't really see the light but guess it will be better when it's dark",4
"If you don't mind it splattering a little bit, this is a nice fountain. It's a case of the pump not quite being matched to the capacity of the fountain, so you will want to turn it to the minimum speed. Also, a couple of things that aren't mentioned in the instructions... It may seem strange, but your electric cable for the LED light will be underwater. Just be sure and screw the connector on tightly to help it be waterproof. Also the purpose of the sponge isn't mentioned. It shows where the sponge sits, but doesn't say if it's only for packing, or meant to be there while operating the fountain. I found the sound so disagreeable if it was in place while the fountain was operating, that I pulled it out.From past experience with fountains, you will want to follow the advice of cleaning it every week because mold will probably build up in the reservoir just above the water line. Also, even though I use distilled water, there is enough stuff in the air, that eventually slime will start to grow in it if not cleaned regularly.If you keep these things in mind, you will have a very pretty, gurgling fountain to grace your table.",4
I really enjoyed this fountain while it was working as it had a great aesthetic and sounded nice! My pump burned out a little after a month of owning it but the company is super responsive to messages and worked with me on a replacement! I've been very happy with the experience!,4
I know I saw the measurements but it’s still on the small side. A bit of water sound is nice. It is stable and the filter is quiet. Wish it were a few inches bigger all around but that is my fault for not visualizing correctly.,4
"Refreshing to the eyes, music to the ears.",4
"First, this is a beautiful fountain made of resin and it's fairly heavy as well. I got it for use next to my desk in my office. It looks lovely there and it's very quiet while running.It was difficult to get the pump inside it, however. I like that the little light part was already connected, but the pump has to be connected and placed inside a very small space. I found this pretty hard to do and it took more than one try.The other thing I think would have been great is to have an on/off switch. This has to be plugged in to work and unplugged to stop. I will have to move it from beside my desk because I can't crawl under the desk every day .Other than these small inconveniences, this is a lovely fountain and so peaceful. It makes me smile and quiets my heart watching it.All in all, it's a good purchase. I would give this item as a gift as well.",4
Received the item nice and in good condition. Thank you,4
Did have a chip in it bit rest all good.,4
"This indoor tabletop water fountain is attractive and relaxing. The fountain comes with a pump and crystal ball on top. The fountain looks beautiful with four tiers made of stones and a bottom layer to recycle the water. The fountain was simple to set up, taking minutes to assemble, and began working after adding water and plugging it in.The LED light adds a nice ambiance, but it's just one colour. The addition of a clear, glass ball on the top tier creates a mesmerizing effect as it spins with the flow of water, reflecting light beautifully. The pump operates quietly in the background. On the downside, it is a bit pricey for a small tabletop fountain. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a charming and relaxing water fountain to add to their home decor.",4
"Top 3 Pros- Water Sounds- Plenty of pebbles to place on the base- Easy setupTop 3 Cons,- Trickle sound vs a deeper sound- Splashes a little- Pump hums louder after a bit of useSimi quiet pump (other review mentioned they can be noisy) not overpowering the water sound but can be heard if you are paying attention for it. I filled it how I usually do, Put distilled water in the base, start pump and pour water into the water outlet and then unplug, let it sit for 10seconds and then plug in, no noise and pumps well. Also lots of stones I usually have enough for one layer this had some spares that could go on top and add some depth.Overall ,Great product and some tweaks could make it feel more premium but over all suits my needs and sounds good.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I don't usually write reviews, but I wanted to put this out there just in case there is someone looking at indoor fountains looking at them for that particular thing I was. I need the Flowing water sound too. This one IS beautiful, the spinning ball is very pretty, the lights are pretty, the case is pretty, but it's missing the most intangible piece, the gurgling water. It's almost silent. The sound of running water is exactly WHY I wanted a fountain on my computer desk. It calms my brain. Thus I may be looking for another. ::sigh::",4
The noise level is a tricky question the motor doesn’t make any noise but the fountain doesn’t make the water trickling sound that one get a fountain to hear.,4
"My child had been asking for a desktop fountain and after looking at many options, he chose this one. The rolling ball is really cool, especially since it is lit up from below. The fountain came with good instructions, which made for easy set up. The mister is really cool to watch, but results in the whole counter getting wet as the mist settles, which is a little bit of a problem since ours is sitting on a wooden bookshelf. Luckily the mister has a separate power source, so our solution is to just turn it on for a little bit and then unplug it. The fountain is well made and worth the price. The motor is not noisy and the trickling of water is a nice ambient sound. My child often turns it on before bed and falls asleep to the sound.One more comment - the picture shows what appear to be live fish in the fountain. This fountain would definitely not be a good long term home for fish. As a fish owner, this is pretty obvious and I told my kid going in that we would not actually be able to put fish inside, but if you didn't know much about fish, the picture might be deceiving.",4
"I love squirrels and mushrooms so I was quite happy to discover this little fountain. My only complaint is that I can barely hear the water running, which is why I gave it only 4 stars. So, if you're wanting a fountain you can hear, this isn't it. But it's cute and it's relaxing to watch anyway. I still really enjoy it.",4
I had one just like this and it worked great for several years. The solar part got a white film and eventually it wouldnt come off. It still worked until the little motor stopped working. This one is too small for the pot I use for my fountain. I don't like it.,4
I liked the idea that with a minimum of work it is possible to create a nice Atmosphere and have a water feature in my small garden. Lately the solar panels stopped working even though we are still in summertime and gave plenty of sun. It worked well for about 5 months.,4
"This works so easily. It adds the perfect touch to my front yard. I just bought a large planter, filled it with water, and placed this fountain in it. The only thing is I wish it would store solar power so that it would also work on a cloudy day or into the evening. It has to have sunlight on it to work. It is easy to clean and is a cheaper option for wanting a fountain without all the extra cleaning and work. I definitely recommend.",4
"Works great in my birdbath! I wish the 4 centering pegs were attached better, I took off one star for that - some large birds ended up removing them from the fountain and I had to look for them in my yard a couple times. There isn't a good way to glue them on either. Some of the reviewers mentioned this product stops working - and I did experience that a couple times when the birdbath went dry. I brought it inside, cleaned the filter material, and then took it back outside in the sun where I had to shake it quite a few times vigorously until I could feel it working again. As long as the birdbath had water, the product worked well when the sun was out. Another note: I could only use the downward flowing fountain attachment, all the other attachments caused the water to shoot outside the birdbath. But that was fine - I just wanted water movement in the bird bath, and this did the job.",4
I would have thought the solar battery would last longer !,4
"The media could not be loaded. This is really a good solar water fountain for the garden. It adds more beauty to your garden. The drawback of the product is, it cannot store solar energy, so direct sunlight is required for this to work. It will not work in shades",4
"I would give it 5 stars, except some of the little fountain spouts seem to have gotten clogged. But it's a really cute little fountain, runs on solar and does the job. Would recommend, especially for the price.",4
"This was a gift for my husband. It fits in a large bowl or container of some sort. I put his into a Very Large Bowl, it looked so pretty. The only reason I gave it four stars was because the water splashed outside the bowl when the slightest breeze came up. My husband ended up returning it. If you have a ""quiet"" place to set this up, it would be perfect.",4
"The media could not be loaded. I really like this solar powered bird bath fountain pump. It works really well in direct sunlight. Let's get to some pros and cons of this solar fountain pump. I will try to include a video and some pictures. Pros: (1)-Works great in constant direct sun. (2)-No batteries needed. (3)-Its gorgeous and the birds loves it. (4)-It comes with everything you need including 5 different water spray nozzle patterns & plastic straw like support beams to keep it centered in the middle of the bird bath which keeps it from moving around. Cons: (1)-The water splashes everywhere especially if it's windy outside. (2)-You will need to refill the bird bath bowl with water every few hours because the water dissipates from the bird bath really quickly. The reason? Refer back to con #1. (3)-It was a little pricey but I would buy this again if I had a large fountain or a pool in my backyard. (4)-These solar fountain pumps is ideal for a pool or a large fountain because the water will deplete every few hours in a very small bird bath like the one I have in my backyard. (5)-Must have direct sunlight for it to work. No sunlight 🌞 no working fountain. They are fun to watch, but just make sure you put it in a pool or a large bird bath or water fountain if you don't want to refill a small bird bath fountain bowl every few hours. Truthful & unbiased review.",4
"As soon as the sun hit it, the pump started working! I covered the solar panels with my hand and it stopped! So cool! The ""straws"" for drawing in the water were too long so I cut them in half. It fits well and still works well.Update: I have learned that if it's cloudy, the pump doesn't work as well. It pumps water every 2-3 seconds and it only goes about 2 inches up. But when it's sunny it works great. Don't be disappointed if this happens, just be patient.Oh yeah, don't forget to add water every day.",4
"I opened the package and there were so many parts. But all we needed were the base and one or two other pieces for a basic fountain. All the variations will probably never be used. The sticks to keep the disk stable is not useful because after a while the water level goes down due to spillage and evaporation and then the fountain doesn't work though the motor keeps going. Better to just let it float according to the level. I thought the mesh that come with it will be useful to keep out debris, but there are no instructions on how to use it. I have to refill the water every day. But the good thing is that the aeration during the day keeps the water from getting murky. Adding water is enough. I have been enjoying it for a week. I hope it lasts.I took off one star for unnecessary parts, packaging and poor instructions.",4
"It works good so far however, I didn’t read the reviews that specifically said there is no battery to store power. That’s on me for not checking. Luckily, I do live in an area with a lot of sunshine in the Summer. I would have liked it to work in the morning and evening but it’s fine for now. The second problem is that I can’t get the unit to stay centered in my bird bath. It floats freely and I lose water over the sides. I need to find a stand that will still allow the water to be pumped through the fountain. (not a huge issue but it bugs me) It was inexpensive so I can live with the issues.",4
Works good but has to be in direct sun so that was alittle disappointing,4
You have to adjust but it's not as sturdy as I hoped. But the birds love it.,4
"This works just fine for the price will run all day if in direct sun, but only direct sun. If your bird bath is in direct sun this is an affordable fountain.",4
I had one just like this and it worked great for several years. The solar part got a white film and eventually it wouldnt come off. It still worked until the little motor stopped working. This one is too small for the pot I use for my fountain. I don't like it.,4

"The media could not be loaded. This solar powered fountain works very well. I placed it in a small bird bath and tried to use the suction cups underneath to secure it to the bowl. The cups don’t work well and the fountain unit was always tilted. This caused the spray to go all over my patio and I was refilling the bowl every 30 minutes or less. Finally I attached the stabilizing straws to the unit. While not aesthetically pleasing, the stabilizing straws keep the unit in the middle of the bowl and less water on the ground. Haven’t had to refill it yet and it’s been two hours.",4
Good and it works. The only limitation is if one day the cloud is dark and there is less sun then this thing won’t work at all.,4
"Works as long as the sun is shining directly on it. Does not store any solar energy. If someone stands between it and the sun, it stops working.",4
"This is a great option to have a water feature in the garden. The only downside is that it only works when the sun is out. On a gloomy day, there is no water feature… which is fine because it is a gloomy day anyway.",4
Kind of cheap but does the job.,4
"Works fantastic in full sun. My local garden shop sells this exact model for $80 - very glad I checked the price here.However, it is pathetic in partial shade. If the shadow of a wasp passes over it, the fountain putters out and stops working until the insect flies away.The different heads makes it easy to adjust the amount of spray. The filter needs cleaning at least once a week, twice a week during an algae bloom. But it's super-simple to take apart and put back together.",4
"It's much smaller than the ones we have had in the past. Two will fit comfortably in a birdbath dish that our kitties have for an outdoor ""water bowl"".",4
"No spider legs on this model so it spouts over the edge, But, when I walk out to the porch my garden hose and nozzle which hangs from the porch can squirt the 20 feet or so and refill / refresh the water. So, slightly more required of me but better for freshness of water in my birdbath.",4
I liked the idea and photos a lot however the sun must directly be on it to work. Once the shade moves over it stops. Also this solar fountain needs to be in a large container- I had hoped to use it in a small birdbath but is pumps all the water out onto the ground and the dish runs dry.,4
I used this for a bird bath. It pumps good but I don't use any of the spray heads. They throw water out pretty fast and I'd have to fill my bird bath several times a day. Works good for the price. I'd buy it again.,4
A simple solar unit that gets wet and still works as long as the sun shines.... stops when the sun is blocked. Birds are not afraid to get closer.,4
Worked all spring and summer.,4
The media could not be loaded. It works better than expected. It seems to only work when the sun is shining. Cloudy or night there is not a solar charge for it to keep working. Wish it had a battery to work during periods of shade or cloudy days.,4

"Pros: It works nicely. So far seems to have a good power for it's size. Has the perfect spray for a bird bath. Birds are loving it. I'm honestly not sure what people are complaining about parts not fitting??? they may have gotten a different model or were missing a piece??? Everything went together easily for me. It's got a nice size spray so you're going to want a pretty decent size bath or the overspray may drain your bird bath quickly.Cons: The solar panel needs SOLID direct sunlight. In the summer heat, I prefer to keep the bath in the shade to keep it from getting too hot. Gave it a 4 because I would preferred the cord to be longer so I can keep the bath under the tree and the panel in a part of the yard that's full sun. The cord is not bad, just not long enough.Note: Niether pro nor con...The panel does not have battery storage. When the sun is gone, the pump stops (I knew this before purchase). This does not bother me at all since the birds don't normally ""bathe"" in the dark.",4
I was so excited to get this but you must know that the panel doesn't seem to store the power from the sun and so panel must be in direct sun at all times to make it work - any shadow on.panel it stops.,4
I used this all summer for out pond. Like the product,4
"It works great when it's sunny outside. When it's cloudy it's still works a little. I gave it 4 stars, would have given 5 if it had a battery backup, but for the price I can't expect much. I'm satisfied though.I would recommend it.",4
"I bought this little pump for a bird bath. It works as expected with adequate power, and the many nozzle attachments give a lot of spray possibilities. It does need to be cleaned frequently because it sucks in all the bird bath debris and plugs up.First problem: the little suction cups on the bottom of the device are useless to hold it in place. I finally used three small rocks to keep it in the center of the water.Second: spray height and volume are highly variable depending on amount of sunlight, so it's hard to regulate on a sun/cloud day. Add wind, and the water blows everywhere out of the bird bath. Most of the nozzles shoot water too high to be useful in a bird bath when it's sunny. I need to refill water repeatedly.So....the pump works just fine except for the suction cups (not sure for how long; I've only used it for a few weeks), but it doesn't really work in a bird bath. And it will require an anchoring system of some kind to keep it from randomly floating around your body of water and spraying everywhere!",4
"Si me gusto, buen producto",4
I love this case! I had recently cracked the entire back of my phone due to having a non- protective case on it. I ordered this otter box because it’s cute but also provides protection. It fits my phone perfectly and is very comfortable to hold. It has protected the camera in the back and is very durable - I don’t even have a scratch on it yet!,5
"I’ve been through a few phone cases for my iPhone 14 Pro Max and haven’t found one that fits it well (particularly around the rear facing camera)…until now! I don’t understand how so many different cases don’t fit something as popular as an iPhone (especially in the exact same place and way). The magnet is the right amount of strength too, not at all weak so holds on to my car mount, but easy to remove if you are intentionally trying to remove it from a mount or charger.",5
"I love this phone case. It’s not bulk or slippery and I love the shimmer. I also use a metal magnetic mag safe pop socket and it sticks amazingly. I’ve dropped my phone several times with this case on and it protects it. Otter box is great! I just bought a new one to replace my old one, which was about a year and a half old. They last a long time but it will yellow over time. I recommend replacing once a year to keep it looking clear and pretty.",5

The colors are vibrant, the details are sharp, and the fluidity makes fast-paced games feel immersive and responsive.Sleek, modern, and undeniably ROG. The RGB keyboard is customizable and adds a premium feel, while the cooling system is highly effective and keeps the laptop running optimally even during long sessions.For a gaming laptop, the Strix G16 strikes a great balance between performance and portability. It’s lightweight enough to carry around without sacrificing the power you’d expect from a desktop replacement.While gaming laptops are known for short battery lives, the G16 pleasantly surprised me with its efficiency during non-gaming tasks.For the specs and performance this machine offers, it’s worth every penny. It’s an investment that will serve well for years to come.Whether you’re gaming, streaming, or editing, the ASUS ROG Strix G16 is a beast. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a reliable, high-performance laptop!",5

"I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16"" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!",5
I like that's nearly the quietest laptop compared to its competitors with same specs. also I'm impressedwith the GPU performance.maybe there's some coilwhine yeah but very minor to notice.overall I really like it!!,5
"The laptop performs well, with about 4 months of usage and it is still rock solid.",5
"I invested in the Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set, and my kitchen experience has been nothing short of wonderful. This 18-piece set is a complete arsenal for all your culinary adventures. With each knife designed for a specific task, it's like having a professional kitchen right on your countertop.The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design and the comfort grip handles. These knives not only look gorgeous on my kitchen counter, but the grip is so ergonomic that chopping has become a less tedious task. The brushed stainless steel handles offer a secure and comfortable grip, making the knives easy to control even during demanding tasks.The high carbon stainless steel blades are the stars of the show. They are stain, rust, and pit resistant, which is a testament to their durability. With a satin finish, they glide through ingredients with ease. The variety of knives in this set is impressive, catering to all kinds of food prep tasks like chopping, cutting, slicing, peeling, and much more.Now, while the knives are sharp and ready to use out of the box, I did notice that they might need frequent sharpening with heavy use. The good news is that the set includes a sharpening steel, so keeping the blades sharp and ready is not a chore.The rubber wood block that houses the knives is compact and stylish, fitting well in any kitchen setting. The set includes a chef's knife, bread knife, ham knife, santoku knife, utility knife, vegetable knife, paring knife, sharpening steel, and eight steak knives, all neatly organized in a rubber wood block.The affordability of this set is a cherry on top. It's a budget-friendly option without compromising on quality or functionality. The Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set is indeed a valuable addition to any kitchen. The quality, the range of knives, and the price point make it a commendable choice. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen game without breaking the bank.",5
"I needed some knives for a horror movie I'm filming. I don't want people to die but I love making movies about it. I needed a block of knives that weren't good chef's knives but that we could use to film.They look GREAT on camera!!! Not the best for cooking if you're a chef but you already know that. They came sharp and even made the ""shink!"" sound when pulled out.If you actually care about good knives, get good knives. These are fine as a movie prop.",5
"I love the price of these. They're very basic, run-of-the-mill knives, but the product is well made. I needed a new set of knives on a budget (my old dull ones weren't very practical) and these showed up on my page. Very nice product for the price, allowed me to get a new set of knives on a budget",5
Great value for the money! You get alot of knives in this set and also many different types depending on the use you need. They are VERY sharp and cut beautifully,5
I am really happy with this knife set. The block is beautiful on its own and the knives are terrific. I would highly recommend this high-quality knife set.,5
Very sharp and pretty set,5
i got these to replace an old set that was missing(thanks honey) pieces. it's true apparently they don't make good gardening tools. I've been using them for a while now and can vouch for their build quality. they work very well and i use them every day. it's a lovely set and perfect for someone on a budget or a gift for the child who finally moved out... just saying.,5
"I love these knives! The block is nice, the craftsmanship really shines, and was sooooo happy with how affordable they were. Just be careful cause they’re hella sharp!",5
"No negatives. This faucet was super easy to install, and it looks great! I needed a way to dispense water from the under counter filtered water system without drilling a hole in the granite. This faucet is the perfect solution. It easily connected to the filter system (Aquasana) without any additional hardware. To dispense the filtered water through the cross bar simply pull the lever straight down. The quality of the faucet is high end, heavy duty and sturdy. I love the way the black and brushed nickel finish goes with my countertop. I also love how firmly the nozzle retracts and stays up without sagging down.",5
I wanted a nice looking faucet that I could use for reverse osmosis & regular water. This fit the bill. Gorgeous & functional! Don’t hesitate to buy it.,5
"Looks great 10/10 and a very easy installationLove that it doesn’t smear or get dirty fastFeels very durable and solid , water flow is amazing high flow and doesn’t leak at all",5
I have made the mistake of going the cheap route with kitchen hardware because brands like Moen and Kohler are always beyond expensive. Kraus feels like a well established brand that continues to try and sell quality products at a great price point. I also got a sink from them (amazon open box) and both looks amazing compared to what we had before. The filtered drinking water option is also a godsend.,5
"Great faucet, absolutely love it. Wanted to save on counter space so needed a faucet that combined RO into the same faucet. Have it for a while already and works great. No complaints at all.",5
Easy to install and very nice quality. Looks great in our kitchen.,5
"Have been using this for over a month now, and it's been great! Good build quality, looks great, and having the filtered water built-in as opposed to needing to drill a separate hole in the counter is really convenient (and works well)! I would highly recommend this faucet.EDIT: Following up again 7 months later, and this faucet is still great! It remains sturdy and still looks great.",5
"Very few kitchen faucets that include a dedicated separate filtered water tap. This saved me the toil of drilling a hole on my ceramic sink for a separate filtered water tap.Works well and is well built, albeit somewhat pricey. Mine was discounted as it was used, otherwise I would have been hesitant. In retrospect I would not have greatly regretted paying full price.Installation instructions were easy to follow.",5
"Perfect product if you have a RO system under the sink and you don't one an extra faucet. Looks really good, and minimal it's easy to install and to use.The colour is a true champagne gold and not as ""yellow"" as it looks in the pictures.",5
"This faucet is awesome for those who wants to add RO water to without drilling a hole. The nut design is super easy to install, it has two Philip screws that does the final tightening; brilliant.For me, I took the old RO water hole and turn it into a glass rinser.",5
"I'll cut to the chase for anyone who simply wants to know if Vitamix blenders are worth the investment. My answer is yes. Unequivocally.This is my second Vitamix. My first one (the 6300) is about 7 years old & STILL going strong, but I was happy to have the opportunity to try this new Ascent X4 because of the presets for many of the things I commonly blend. The 5 presets (smoothies, frozen desserts, soups, frozen cocktails, and last but not least, dips & spreads) take the guesswork out of which settings to use for many of the types of foods & beverages that I make on a regular basis.So far, I've used the presets on my Ascent X4 to blend smoothies & frappes and to clean my container when I've finished using it. (Btw, not that it was difficult to do this manually with my 6300, but I love the self-cleaning feature!) In addition, even though there's no preset for it on this model I was still able to make a great, super-smooth batch of almond butter with help from the ""dips and spreads"" setting, too!More things I love about the Ascent X series:- 10-year warranty -- almost unheard of these days- smart technology that tells me when I should use the tamper (if I'm not already using it)- clever tamper storage that conveniently fits on either side (I'll never need to hunt for it again!)- ability to blend manually without using a preset and includes a ""pulse"" feature- additional 15 seconds can be added with one touch on the ""15+""- motorized base accepts all self-detect containers, including a food processor (I can hardly wait to get that one!)- container is dishwasher safe (it self-cleans exceptionally well but some might like this option)- easy to see when it's *powered on -- lights appear on the display, or off -- no lights (*Btw, the power button is hidden on the lower right side of the base beneath the edge. I say this because I had trouble finding it myself, lol.)I'll end with the fact that Vitamix stands 100% behind their products and the company has STELLAR customer service. If there's any issue with your blender or its components it's easy to contact them by phone. Not only do you get to talk with a real person, but those who answer calls are friendly, knowledgeable & helpful. I speak from experience.",5
"I bought a Vitamix in 1999, and it's still going strong to this day. I have used and abused it over the years and it just keeps on going. I wanted to get a more modern version that has electronic optionsfor pre-programmed features like smoothies, etc. I have to admit that I was a little concerned that Vitamix would follow the trend of many popular, formerly high-quality brands by making products *look* better while lessening overall quality. I'm relieved to report that as far as I can tell, this machine is still a high quality machine that I would expect from Vitamix. The base and motor sounds feel and sound familiar... like an old friend. I love that even though there are pre-programmed functions, you still have the option to run the machine like an old Vitamix. That is, on/off and a dial to hone in on the perfect speed for what you're making. You can turn it on and go without having to navigate menus to find a ""manual"" mode. For professional chefs and experienced home cooks, this is important.The pre-programmed options are great. Combined with the extensive recipe book, you can make flawless recipes! If you're a beginner home cook, this machine could change your life.One thing I made all the time in my previous Vitamix is hummus, so that's the first thing I tried in the new one. And when I say I make hummus, I start by making tahini from sesame seeds and oil. The Vitamix handled this step flawlessly. In seconds, I had a beautiful tahini base for my hummus. Next I added chickpeas, lemon, salt and a bit of water. This Vitamix made a beautiful, super creamy and smooth hummus. I know some people like hummus that's a little rough, but I prefer a super smooth one and that's completely doable in this Vitamix.I was kind of hoping that in their years of R&D that they would have found a way to make it easier to get thick food like hummus out of the canister more easily, but that's a big ask. So I did have to use a spatula to get all the goodness out of the bottom.I have made some smoothies, mayo and potato soup -- all things my previous Vitamix did effortless, and this new model handles all these tasks without complaining. It truly is a beautiful machine and I'm really excited to keep using it and trying new things.My only concern for the future is the electronics side of things. I hope they engineered that as well as the motor and other physical aspects. With the old Vitamix, there are 2 switches and a dial. There's not much to go wrong as long the motor is working. And Vitamix makes powerful and quality motors, which is why my 25 year-old Vitamix shows no signs of slowing down today. Since I can't really test the electronics side of things, I'm really hoping they did put the R&D and build quality into that side of things as well.Overall, I'm super happy with this latest professional grade model and am so happy that Vitamix is still making high-quality and user-friendly products!",5
"I can now make dinner in a flash - and saves my sanity when chopping broccoli.No more mess in the kitchen, it works great and is of really good quality.Blades are sharp and I love the tool to protect your fingers which does not come with the other models I have seen.Does require some strength though - my kids struggle with harder veggies so I had to help.Popped everything in the dishwasher after use and made cleaning up so easy. We love it so far.",5
This chopper is awesome. I have a single chopper but this was is so fast and easy to use and clean.,5
"I have almost nothing to complain about with this kit. It cuts effortlessly compared to the cheaper one I used to have. Doesnt really matter what, onions, peppers, apples, carrots, potatoes, all of them go through it like a hot knife through butter. The ergonomics are great, I will say that I have yet to use the mandoline portion on top. Just haven't had a use case yet. But if the blades in that are as good as they are in the chopper, I don't doubt that it will have just as good as an experience. The storage for the blades is convenient and well thought out. I especially love the little comb that you can use to clean out the plate that pushes things through the blades. It makes cleaning up much easier than any previous chopper that I've used. My only real complaint about this is that the container that the chopped food enters is a bit too short. This both limits how much you can chop before having to empty the container, and it also prevents you from being able to fully close the chopper up with all the blades in their storage recepticles. Its a bit of a nitpick honestly. But it would be nice to have everything securely in one spot without having to worry about anything falling out if it gets tipped over.Other than that, great buy, highly recommend. Also I love the color!",5
"It’s sharp, easy to assemble, and saves time chopping vegetables. Highly recommend!",5
"I got this dicer for 50% off, I think, paying only $30 or so for a normally $60 dicer. This is the first dicer that I have ever owned, although I have used a friend's dicer, and I will say that this cuts through about anything that you would need to dice in the kitchen. Like most dicers, stuff gets caught and stuck in the blades and the platform thingy, and it's a little hard to wash, especially because those blades are seriously sharp. An onion stands no chance against those blades. All of the different tools/slicers are really awesome and work really well for the most part.It isn't quite as big as what I thought it would be when I purchased it, and to give you an idea, most of the time I need to quarter an onion in order for it to be diced correctly and not smush out of the sides. If it's a small onion, you can fit half of it in the dicing area and get it done that way. I am extremely happy with the purchase overall, especially at that price, and it has taken away a lot of frustration and time when I cook. Next time, I will probably get one that's a little bigger, but this is most definitely a game changer by itself. Highly recommend this dicer. Just be careful with those blades! They are super sharp and got two of us bleeding within the first three or four days. Lol",5
"This chopper is just awesome . Nicely built , no cheap plastic . And all blades are sharp .",5
Solid and great quality. The blades are thick and the plastic parts do not feel flimsy. Very useful.,5
Highly recommended,5
"The media could not be loaded. I recently upgraded my kitchen with the CAROTE 11-piece Non-Stick Pots and Pans Set, and it's been a game-changer for my cooking routine. The cream white color gives my kitchen a clean, modern look, and the non-stick surface truly lives up to its claims. Food slides right off, making both cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love that I can use less oil, and even delicate foods like eggs don’t stick, which makes every meal feel healthier and fresher.One of my favorite features is the removable handle, which is incredibly practical. It snaps on and off easily, so I can transfer pots from stovetop to oven or fridge without taking up extra space or needing separate storage for bulky handles. This space-saving design has been perfect for my small kitchen and would be amazing for anyone with limited storage or even an RV setup. Plus, the set is induction-compatible, which opens up a lot of versatility, especially if you have mixed appliances.Overall, this CAROTE cookware set has been an ideal addition to my kitchen. It's lightweight but durable, easy to clean, and does everything I need it to do, from stovetop to oven to fridge. It’s been a worthwhile investment, and I can tell it’s going to last me a long time. If you’re looking for a practical, stylish, and space-efficient cookware set, I highly recommend giving CAROTE a try!",5
"Absolutely amazing!!! Best purchase I’ve done in a while. The coating makes it super easy to cook and food really doesn’t stick, even with small amounts of oil or similar. The removable handles are great and easy to apply and remove. The color is lovely, the little dots give it a little extra something that looks very nice. The fact that you can take them from stove to oven to the table and they still look cute it’s definitely a great extra. Heat distribution is amazing! Everything cooks very evenly! The stacking makes is easier to store and they are also super easy to clean.",5
"I bought these to save my time in the kitchen, and the results are better than expected. I like the detachable handles, since they allow me to squeeze more pots on my stovetop, while eliminated bumping a handle and spilling the contents. They nest well in a drawer, using less than half the space required by my old pots. The non stick coating has held up very well, and I am saving more time than I planned when cleaning them",5
"“I am absolutely thrilled with this CAROTE Pots and Pans Set! The non-stick coating works flawlessly, making cooking and cleanup a breeze. I love the space-saving design – the detachable handle is such a clever feature, especially for storing everything neatly in my small kitchen and even fitting them in the fridge! The cream white color adds a touch of elegance, and the set is versatile enough for all my cooking needs. It heats evenly on my induction stovetop, and being oven-safe is a huge plus. This set has truly upgraded my cooking experience – I can’t recommend it enough!”",5
I've been looking at these for a while and finally gave in and got them. I have an issue with my pots and pans not being able to fit into the cupboard properly number one because they don't all settle into each other perfectly and the handles stick out. So far they seem to cook through very evenly they're heavy weight and easy to clean. They're very pretty looking and it's super convenient to have the handle store next to it. Also the lids are nice that they function is a cover and the whole pan and lid can be put into your refrigerator together or take into another person's house. It eliminates the need for Tupperware. For the price I have found these in extremely good buy and would recommend them to other people,5
"As an avid cook, I’ve been searching for the perfect pots and pans for a long time, and after trying many, I can't believe I didn't discover these sooner! These pots and pans are lightweight yet durable, with a non-stick surface that makes cooking and cleaning a breeze. I ended up discarding half a dozen of my old ones after using these. What I love most is how they store in my cabinet – the detachable handles allow me to stack them neatly, saving so much space. Plus, the inclusion of high-quality felt sheets for protection shows they really care about the product’s longevity. The price is great, and I will definitely buy these again as gifts!",5
"The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the T-fal Ultimate Hard Anodized Nonstick Fry Pan Set, and it has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. The nonstick coating is impressive – even with minimal oil, food slides right off without sticking. This makes cooking so much easier and clean-up even faster, as I can simply wipe the pans with a sponge and they’re good as new. Another thing I love is how evenly these pans heat up; whether I’m cooking vegetables or frying eggs, there are no hot spots, so everything cooks perfectly. The set feels durable and well-made, with comfortable handles that stay cool while cooking. Overall, this set is an excellent value for anyone looking for quality, user-friendly frying pans.",5
"I'm doing an initial review of this cookware set. As it's being used, my intention is to come back to this review with updates.I ordered this set after doing a bit of 'googling' on what is the best cookware set for 2019 - I wanted something for our gas range. I think it's something to take into consideration when choosing what you're going to buy. An example - on a gas range - if the setting is high and your cookware has some sort of enamel-like finish, and the flames are coming over the sides of the pot/pan - it's going to discolor the finish after a period of time.I looked at the top 10 bracket, the top 5 bracket, I went to reviews, Good Housekeeping, Consumer Reports, just to name two of several, and surprisingly (at least for me) T-Fal was a set that kept popping up as one of the best. I've always thought of T-Fal as one of those starter cookware sets that someone might purchase when they're moving into their first apartment and starting out on their own - it is/was inexpensive - a set for a person learning to cook and therefore not requiring something more 'higher-end.' If you have/had those thoughts as well, you might want to set them aside, at least with this set..Upon pulling everything out of the box my first impression was they look really nice. The set is light weight - the handles are riveted, silicone encased and can withstand up to 400 degree oven temperature. The lids are heavy tempered glass, each one having a small vent hole, and the handles are also silicone encased as well. The design of the lid-handles seems to take into account the use of pot holders since there's substantial space between the glass and the handle itself. All of the lids in my set fit nicely onto their respective pot/pan - no warpage or bent rims. The pots/pans are dishwasher safe (mine aren't going to see the inside of a dishwasher), and this particular set you can use metal utensils (I personally ain't-a-gonna do it). It comes with a steamer that is designed to stack on top of the large pot (not the dutch oven). When you're done steaming, grab some pot holders and lift the insert out by it's handles - no muss, no fuss. It's a much better option than the collapsible steamer I currently using.It comes with instructions on how to care for your cookware. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Why you may ask? This set is replacing a Calphalon set, and yes Calphalon was/is rated highly as well. But why replace it? Because being the knuckle head that I am, I didn't read the instructions. I knew Calphalon had to be hand washed (at least the set that I own) - but what I didn't know was what high heat does to the pots. When you read the instructions for T-Fal, and because it's aluminum, it'll say something to the effect of using low to medium heat (because aluminum conducts heat really well). See … I didn't know that about anodized aluminum and what I ended up doing was burning the finish off of each pot and skillet bottom of my Calphalon set - right down to the bare aluminum and of course this affected the non-stick surface on the inside. So please, read and follow the instructions. One other thing before I wrap this up. When I was doing my 'research' I came across this one video of an owner showing how an empty T-Fal pot didn't sit level on her stove. Seems the handle was heavy enough that it caused the pot to tip. She said this was a problem - and I guess it could be if you're in the process of putting something inside the pot in preparation of cooking. I do get that - but I placed an empty pot on the stove, centered over the burner, and it sat just fine - although I'll say my stove grate is different than the stove in the video - it also sat level on the counter top. Perhaps this might be something to take into consideration???So initial impression is the set seems to be of good quality, looks nice, and I'm looking forward to putting this set through it's paces.UPDATE:As of December 4, 2019 I have to say that the T-Fal set has held up extremely well - cooking with this set is a breeze. I keep the burner setting usually at med-high if I want to bring something to a boil - and it doesn't take long for that to happen. The pots and pans conduct heat really well and there's practically no sticking. Usually I can pretty-much rinse off any food residue left behind using just running hot water. I'm pretty good at using either wooden or silicon-type utensils when cooking, though on occasion I've used metal spoons to stir, and there are no marks inside any of the pots/pans. I'm not one of those cooks adept enough to shift a pan around and flip the contents briefly into the air (my cool-factor is not that high) so ""skating"" the bottom of a pot/pan over the cast-iron grate has not taken place, so I can't say what would happen to this set if I were to do so. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that more than likely there would be some marring of the bottom since cast iron probably trumps aluminum. Overall I'm very please with this purchase and the performance of this cook set.",5
"I try to wait on reviews so that I can provide an accurate and fair review. This was a great purchase. These pans look amazing and are very sturdy. Stick fee is 5 stars. Durability 5 stars. Look new after 6 months. Easy to keep clean. After 6 months no scratches or marks. I will admit that I an very careful about cleaning and us only cloth or sponge as I have ruined other, more expensive brands in the past.",5
"We all have some of these: chipped, scratched pots and pans that wobble on a range because of being WARPED. I've had enough with my pans and began research on cookeware sets. I will note here that my current cookware is the high end non-stick, with my fry pans being those bought after watching some fool on TV melt candy in a wrapper in the pan and then wiping it clean. (These pans by the way are only 8 months old and are already WARPED). For new cookware, my ONE main requirement was that they were or would be NON-WARPING. The second requirement was that they be non-stick. After some research I settled on the 14 piece of T-Fal non-stick / non-warp set. Item came well packaged and unpacking the items I was impressed with the feel of each piece: not too heavy or light even with a lid. I also noted the non-stick interior surface and the very nice looking anodized exterior. Very nice touch with the vented lids (an actual hole in the glass) and the FULL insulation of the handles. Now I mention this insulation because I have (had) cookware items that had decorative (?) metal ends on the handles that would occasionally get very warm while being used.( Nothing like grabbing a pot or pan handle that want to cook your hand medium rare.) I washed each piece and WITHOUT SEASONING, took the largest frying pan, placed it on the range on MED HEAT (about 5-6 on an electric glass top range) and let it heat up. After 2-3 minutes, I noted that the T-FAL center emblem in the pan really didn't look like it changed much. I expected it to go from the T-FAL logo to a full red dot. Didn't happen but it was no biggie as in the past several months I began preheating my fry pans for about 3 minutes due to their warped exterior. Next I added magarine as I was going to cook sunnyside up eggs. I was impressed to note that the margarine melted quickly AND when spread about the pan, little bubbles began to show up over the ENTIRE pan surface. This meant that the pan was heating up evenly. In went the eggs and after placing a lid on the pan I turned away to get something off the counter. Now, with my older warped fry pans I could do this same act, return to the range and begin to slowly rotate the pan to get even heating on the eggs. Not so with this T-Fal fry pan. I noted the whites turning opaque quickly and the yolks getting their whitish color meaning they would be just slightly runny. In short, these eggs came out perfect and in well over 1/2 the time from my old cookware. Even my other half was impressed. Now my next ""adventures in cooking"" will involve sautéing, making my alfredo sauce, grilling (this set came with a VERY NICE grill pan!) and frying. So far I am following the instructions by keeping the range heat at MED or just a bit more. Noted is that one foray into frying eggs does not provide enough experience with this cookware to turn cartwheels in the kitchen. But so far, with eggs being one of my more difficult items to make because of my other warped pans with uneven heat, this T-Fal pan is impressive. So, my rating of 4 is tentative as I will update this review within a short time after I try other pieces of this set.UPDATE:First this disclaimer: I HAVE NOT and AM NOT an employee of T-Fal or Amazon, and I have NOT been hired to write a raving review. That said, now for the update. I have had this set now for over a month and have used all but one of the pans. The total experience has been incredible. I cook out of self-defense (the other half is banned by the EPA from boiling water) and am pretty fast in the kitchen when I am cooking.- WEIGHT OF PANS: I thought the pans were a bit on the light side until I started using them. Whether it was thought of during design or not, the pans are heavy enough to withstand various cooking requirements but light enough where you don't break your wrist when lifting.- NON STICK SURFACE: Come on now! Who in their right mind melts plastic spoons or uses an electric beater on their non-stick cookware! I believe surface of this T-Fal would take this abuse with no problem, but I happen to like my food without the taste of plastic. I've used nearly all the pans and found them all to be amazingly non-stick as well as sturdy. I still use butter/olive oil when sautéing or frying. I have had nothing stick to the pans nor have any of these pans lost any of their non-stick capability.- HEATING: This is the BEST part of this cookware. If you cook/have cooked with slightly warped cookware, you know the problem with hot heat spots or very little heat at all. Thus, you have to move the pan around a bit to get yours items cooked. Each of the pans in this T-Fal set has VERY even heat distribution. There is a ""plate"" on the bottom of the pans that distributes the heat evenly. I have found that because of this, I've noted shorter cooking times on various items AND I now cook on a lower heat settings NOTE: This T-Fal cookware set will cause you to change how your cook and for how long. The even heat distribution is stunning. ALSO, I do preheat my pans (except for boiling water) and use only wooden or high heat tolerant silicone utensils..- STORAGE OF THE COOKWARE: I don't stack this cookware. Instead I hang it up. This simply helps prolong the life of my investment.Overall, I am very impressed with this cookware. Even my other half (known for making ANGRY little pellets called hamburgers), has begun to learn that this cookware can even make her a decent cook. And yes, I bit on the late night adverts showing the frying pans melting plastic spoons and candy in wrappers and magically not sticking. I bought 3. Within 90 days they either lost their non-stick capability, began to warp, or both.Some people are gourmet cooks; others have trouble boiling water. This cookware will holdup very well and serve both very well. My motto is that you get what you pay for. And you WILL get more than you've paid for this set. I raise my rating to 5 stars and I do recommend as a BUY.",5
This set of pots is amazing!! They are truly non-stick which makes cooking and cleaning easier. They are worth the price. I would recommend this set to others.,5
"I've had these for a few months now and they have been fantastic. They seem very sturdy, they are easy to clean and everything I've made in them has cooked evenly and nothing has stuck to the pans. I am very happy with this purchase.",5
"While I can't give you a review on durability yet, I can say they seem nice. All parts cake in that I know of. The silicone seems sturdy, I like the fit of the lids and it stacks rather nicely imo. I don't see how a bowl wouldn't be functional, there's really no way to mess that up. I ordered black and think they look pretty sharp. The tools that came with it are small imo also but I wasn't expecting much, they were just kind of a bonus to me really.Enjoy",5
"These bowls and lids are great. I love the shredder and slicer and they clean up easily in the dishwasher. I recommend placing the lids on the top dishwasher rack to ensure the lids maintain their shape but even on the bottom they maintain their shape and seal if you place them on the bowls and leave them on for a while. The sizes allow you to measure, mix, and store right in the bowls. The silicone base is the best feature and provides a firm foundation as you mix vigorously. The extra measuring tools and silicone utensils are a nice bonus. Would buy again as a gift!",5
"Great set of bowls, the rubber bottom really does a great job of keeping it from sliding. Nice variety if sizes, the lid seals well enough for me to use them for storage as well as mixing. I have been washing them in the dishwasher since I got them with now issues. They store easily as well.Some issues with scratching on the insides if the bowl but not a concern",5
"I've been trying to get rid of my glass mixing bowls and I wanted something durable that wasn't plastic. I saw this set and I gave it a try. Best purchase I've made in a while... I LOVE THEM! Durable with a nice rubber bottom. The lids fit like a glove and they are perfectly stackable. The bonus... is the bowl with the slicing and grating attachments. All I do is open the covered hole on the lid, add the attachment and I slice and grate in the bowl. Save me time and clean up. It came with some silicone utensils, measuring cups and spoon. This was a true bonus buy!",5
They look nice! They fit in my cabinets perfectly. They are good quality and can be used for many things. They work good and are easy to clean. I would recommend these if you like to bake they have many sizes.,5
"I got this to take camping. It works great, love how the bowls stack together. Love the non-slip bottoms. The extras - utensils, measuring cups, etc - where great to throw in our camping tub. The lids aren't water-proof, so if you are bringing stuff home in a cooler full of melting ice, keep that in mind. Otherwise, we love it!",5
"There are many items included with this purchase. The utensils are pretty small, but it all works. The use of the cheese grater and other items is nice to have.",5
I love the size and colors,5
"This is the second one I purchased for gifts; I use one myself in the kitchen. I'm a knife collector, as far as chef knives go. A $200 one will not be better. It has a VG 10 core for edge retention. It looks good. Its high chromium/ Nikkel content makes it rust-resistant. It's full-tang, and, best of all, it's very sharp. Quality, appearance, value, weight, balance, comfort, ease of use, ease of cleaning; It's all there. This is a knife every kitchen should have. Highly recommended.",5
They seem to hold an edge and sharpen well also. a good medium priced tool.,5
I started home cooking and got this knifeIt is smooth cutting meat and vegetablesIt’s almost 3 months but still works like the first day,5
Gorgeous blade and exceptionally sharp that holds an edge even with an aggressive bevel.Full tang blade and is surprisingly weighty but no so unwieldy as to be clumsy.It will be the first knife in the drawer you reach for. We all have that one tool that just makes your life easier.,5
Wonderful cutting edge. Also it is sent in a beautiful box which works well for storing the sharp blade.,5
"I seen a few negative reviews about rust, FYI moisture is the worst enemy to this type of steel.Here is how to care for your Damascus Blade. I collect Katanas, which are all Hand Forged blades.FYI: the picture of knife darkens the blade so you can see the Design.When heat treated and used in a blade this combination holds an excellent edge. The blade will gain an attractive patina with prolonged use as with any Carbon steel based blade. The colour and character of the patina is determined by the type of ingredients and food the blade is used to cut. For example, cooked red meat creates a beautiful blue-grey patina that will be familiar to anyone who has encountered heirloom carving knives.Caring for your blade:Caring for a Damascus steel blade is much the same as for a Carbon steel blade - moisture is the enemy. Once the blade has built up a patina it is much more forgiving, but a fresh Carbon steel based blade will begin to rust in a heartbeat.Never, ever: NEVER!Leave the blade resting in standing waterRest the blade on a damp tea towel, wash cloth, etcStore in direct contact with leatherWash in a dishwasherTo help your Damascus steel knife become a heirloom, there are only a few things you need to do.After use:Rinse clean under running water and wipe dry with a clean clothLightly oil using food safe oilStore in a dry placeWhile your blade is still developing a patina, it is a good idea to quickly wipe the blade down before moving on to a food preparation task not involving the knife.Oiling - (I use Japanese Sword Choji Oil)- https://www.amazon.com/The-Institute-of-Asian-Arts/dp/B0061LS2SY?th=1&psc=1A common mistake when oiling a blade is to use something like olive oil that will go rancid. I recommend Choji oil, as it is food safe, cheap, and readily available.WashingMany people new to Damascus steel knives approach washing their blades with trepidation. Cleaning your knife is straightforward: rinse it under running water, give it a wipe with a lightly soapy dish sponge, rinse it again and wipe dry. If you’re familiar with the term “Bachelor Wash” (or can decipher the connotation), this is all it takes.Refreshing the patternThe Damascus pattern will fade with use - this is normal and easy to rectify. Hot black instant coffee (cheap, nasty, and mixed at a ratio that would kill a large animal) is a mild etchant that is used as the final stage of the Damascus etching process. It is element of process that contributes most to the blackness of the pattern.Here’s how to refresh your own blades:Brew a batch of the cheapest and nastiest black instant coffee you can get your hands on. You’ll need enough to immerse the blade in.Wash the blade, then thoroughly wipe it down with methylated spirits to remove oils and contaminantsImmerse the blade in the instant coffee, heating the coffee back up if it’s gone cold (heat increases the rate of reaction). Take care to avoid getting coffee on the handle.Expect the process to take anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour. Check the blade every 15 minutes by removing it from the coffee and allowing the coffee to drip off. Do not touch or wipe down the blade at any point.When the desired results have been achieved, remove the blade from the coffee then wash as normal before oiling and storing.",5
Very good Quality,5
"The media could not be loaded. The best part is the smooth gliding RAZOR edge this knife has out of the box. It's a Chinese made VG-10 steel, damascus style (I can't verify how many layers this really has), but VG-10 steel has a great reputation. The knife shipped OVERNIGHT and by coincidence, I bought fresh Walleye AKA Pickerel today at the grocery store. I've used a survival knife to do this before, but it left way too much meat on the skin. This knife just slid right through. If you're OK buying a knife made in China, I'd pick one of these up. The hype is real.Downsides:1) Nobody can really say if this is damascus or just damascus style, nor have I used it for more than one task, but without seeing the manufacture process, it may or may not be.Fun facts:The VG10 steel is native to Japan. 9CRMOV10 or whatever the top rated Japanese knives are made of is a Chinese steel, copying the VG10. How can a genuine Japanese chef knife (like most of the top rated ones) be made out of a Chinese composition steel, yet still be Japanese? This Japanese STYLE chef knife is made from higher grade steel than any of the Chinese 9CRMOV10ABC steel used in most top rated competitors and it's cheaper.Good stuff gets made in China, and so does junk. For the price point, VG-10 steel and quality so far, I'd have to say this is an excellent knife and not junk.Update Several months later: I can still shave with the blade. To be safe and remove any micro burrs, I dragged it through a ceramic v shaped sharpener for three passes, applying no pressure other than the weight of the knife. The blade is still scalpel sharp and glides through EVERYTHING. USE A WOODEN CUTTING BOARD! ANY blade will eventually suffer damage if it's slammed into a glass cutting board or countertop enough times. I didn't HAVE to use the ceramic either. Removing any micro abrasions from any blade helps them stay sharp, but not essential for this knife. It stayed razor sharp on it's own, so I take good care of it.The hamon line on the edge and damascus pattern in the blade are incredible! From one steel worker to another: great job! Worth EVERY PENNY!",5

These shears combine durability, precision, and convenience, making them a must-have for any home cook.Right out of the box, the quality is evident. The stainless steel blades are sharp and sturdy, perfect for cutting through a variety of ingredients from herbs to poultry. The comfortable handles provide a secure grip, reducing hand fatigue during extended use.One of the standout features is the protective sheath. It keeps the blades safe and clean when not in use, and the built-in blade guard adds an extra layer of safety, which is especially important in a busy kitchen.Versatility is another major plus. I've used these shears for everything from trimming vegetables to opening packaging. The blades are easy to clean, and they remain sharp even after repeated use.Overall, the KitchenAid All Purpose Kitchen Shears with Protective Sheath are a fantastic investment for anyone looking to enhance their kitchen tool arsenal. Their combination of quality, versatility, and safety makes them a perfect addition to any kitchen. Highly recommended!",5
"Ultra sharp (cause it’s new) but I have high hopes. I particularly love the large handles for bigger hands. These kitchen shears cut through anything and at a reasonable price. The best park is since they are like regular scissors instead of that serrated crap, you can sharpen them if they get dull. I started using then to cut herbs and lettuces with great success and no bruising to delicate leaves. I highly recommend.",5
"These kitchen scissors have quickly become one of my most-used tools! They’re super sharp and make quick work of everything from cutting herbs to slicing through packaging with ease. The grip is comfortable, even for long prepping sessions, and the blades stay sharp, handling heavy-duty tasks like a pro. Cleaning is a breeze too—just pop them apart for a quick rinse. They’ve truly replaced a lot of extra gadgets in my kitchen drawer. If you want a versatile and durable pair of scissors, these are a must-have!",5
"These kitchen shears are a huge improvement over our last pair of Pampered Chef scissors from over 15 years ago. They're comfortable in hand, nice and tight, and sharp while not letting the food slip away from being cut. The blade cover is sturdy and snaps securely in place over the pivot for when you're not using the shears.",5
Very sharp and work well,5
"The KitchenAid All Purpose Kitchen Shears are an absolute must-have for every kitchen. These shears are incredibly, versatile and solidly built. The sharp edges make cutting poultry a breeze since I’m mainly using them to cut trim unwanted chicken fats and cubing them for stir fry.Cleanup is effortless and I just use soap and hot water and they come out looking like new every time.",5
"Bought these to replace the Fiesta ones in my knife block. These are sharp and made well. Have used them for months and they are still as sharp as when I got them. They are comfortable and easy to use, even for a left handed cook! No rust from the many washings either.",5
I've had this model for over a decade. It's great. Holds up. And I put it in the dishwasher probably 3-5 times a week and it doesn't rust and continues to function as expected. highly recommend.,5
"Great product from Kitchenaid, delivered ahead of schedule and in excellent condition.",5
"I have been ordering these for years! Great quality! They say you get what you pay for with trash bags, but these are a great buy. Scent free. They fit my standard kitchen trash can perfectly.",5
"Great in cost, and the drawstrings are very sturdy and easy to use. Fits our trash can perfectly.",5
"I have repeatedly bought these bags. They last a long time (the box). The bags hold a decent amount , definitely a sound purchase.",5
"I love these bags. They are sturdy and easy to open. I like the idea that there are 4 rolls in the box. White, no sent and very stretchy. Great price!",5
Great bang for your buck! I’ve been using this brand for years at home and my place of work. They’re amazing! Great quality!,5
These are the most durable and reliable trash bags. My husband and I have been ordering them for a few years now and will never use another trash bag. So great for the price and almost impossible to break.,5
"Good enough bags. I bought on sale thinking they are bags, kind of hard to screw up, and if they are bad well, they were cheap. This is good logic and I am glad we went with it. We have already purchased a second set. No leaking, no tearing. No regerts. They are bags and they work as advertised. Will likely continue to buy.",5
"We fill this with ice and the beverages of the event and set it on the counter. Looks nice and inviting to have glistening ice cold beer, soda or water ready for the taking rather than digging in a cooler. We’ve also used it for a few bottles of wine with glasses at the ready. Very happy with it.",5
"I bought the Twine Rustic Farmhouse Galvanized Beverage Tub for my Christmas Eve Party, and it was an absolute hit! Not only does it look gorgeous with my Christmas Decor, but it’s also super functional.",5
"The handles are very sturdy. The size of this is great. Do be aware that condensation does happen. I love this tin and use it as storage, but have used it to hold ice and drinks when hosting friends. It works great both ways I use it. I love how the twine does not start unwinding like other ones I have had. I would recommend this to anyone!!",5
These are great when entertaining and needing somewhere to keep your beverages cool.,5
The ice melted pretty fast but it didn't leak and it looks nice . Would buy again.,5
"I bought this to make a going away basket for a coworker. I was able to fit quite a bit of gifts! Although lightweight, it was very sturdy and did the job!",5
"This thing is so easy to use! My little 14yr girl was baking COOKIES like how we dreamed of as a kid. Remember those toy oven on TV?Plug it in,place parchment paper on the baking pan,add premade cookies cubes 2” apart,place pan on the “Bake” line,Set oven to “Bake”,Set Temp,Set Time,Press Start/StopWatch magic happens!Remove cookies when golden brownBoom! Good memories!I did have the wattage meter to check the status. On idle it’s 0.2W. On bake it’s ~1,300-1,500W (same as a bedroom space heater). This thing is pretty cool. Toast really well. Got it on sale at $150 during the Amazon Day once a quarter of something. Has been on my wish list for a bit until recently. This thing with right out of the box. Relatively minimal noise level. Can replace the oven, air fryer, and toaster to reduce Valuable countertop real estate. The oven is basically another storage cabinet. Definitely recommend!",5
"I've never owned a toaster oven before and this one has worked very well for my family. It's very versatile as I have used it for an air fryer, rotisserie and roasting so far. I haven't tried dehydration yet but will. This thing doesn't generate a lot of heat so my kitchen doesn't get to hot. It has been easy to clean. Even though it cooks food quick, I am still able to smell the food around the house. I only wish there was a storage drawer for all the pieces that come with it.",5
"It heats up quickly, maintains correct temperatures, is easy to use & keep clean.",5
"The media could not be loaded. My Instant Vortex died just short of 4 years. I opened it up and reset the thermal ""fuse"". It worked but only for about a minute, giving me the E1 error code. Time for an upgrade. The non-stick trays are also in a sorry state.This upgrade is worth it if only for the exterior stainless steel and the cute French door. Air fryers that open the door down always bugged me. Why can't they have a door like the microwave? Everything drips on the door hinge and the door. I had to get another tray to put on top of the opened door as another drip tray. But when I detached the door of the Instant Vortex, there wasn't much grease dirt accumulated there.The door isn't just cute but fully functional. You can open it with one hand, doesn't matter if you are left or right-handed. You need a little bit of clearance on the sides for it to stay open because it's spring-operated.The interface and buttons are superior. There are only 6 buttons including start and cancel. Others control what the dial is used for, setting time, temperature, cooking mode, etc. The buttons are quality sensor buttons with no moving parts. The rubbery membrane buttons are always the first thing to go in any appliance. The little display manages to tell you if you have a preheat mode and where to put your trays.The basket and rack are quality stainless steel. A short time will tell if they are not. The trays look like aluminum which most baking trays are made of. The grill plate is solid steel with ceramic coating. Many will not buy telfon like non-stick utensils. Many will not buy stainless steel utensils. I'm going for all stainless steel in the kitchen. They are easily cleaned by boiling in water with some washing soda. It's effortless to maintain even a mirror finish.Even the tray handle makes a lot of sense. You don't have one for the Instant Vortex. The rotating mechanism is also all metal.My only hesitation is that it doesn't have a rotating basket. My last use of the Instant Vortes was to roast peanuts, overheating in the process. Since this fryer is much bigger, you can spread the same amount of peanut on the flat basket in one layer. An air fryer is supposed to fry evenly.The Instant Vortex basket can be modified to fit the new host. Unscrew the black supporting blocks for the old rotisserie bars. All you need is a thick drill bit to grind off the rivet holding the old rotisserie bars, take them off, and enlarge the resulting hole a little. Screw the supporting blocks back. The new rotisserie can be put through the holed at the two ends.",5
"This thing can literally do everything... even ""hardboil"" eggs! I purchased specifically for the air frying and because a frozen pizza can be easily cooked in it, but I am amazed by everything that it can do - and how well it does it! The pizzas turn out great and it's easy for even my teenagers to use it when they get hungry. While it can fit a full frozen pizza, I don't feel like it takes as much counter space as some other comparable units (Looking at you, Breville). It's easy to clean. I usually just line the bottom tray of the unit with aluminum foil to make it lickety split. Really glad that I purchased it - it does make dinner a breeze and saves me from having to turn on and heat up a big oven if I'm just feeding myself.",5
"I have fallen in love with this thing! You can hear the fan it turns off once cooled down, the beeping is loud but appreciated. It's so easy to use and very versatile. I say it's worth the cost.",5
"Recently my range/stove had broken. Instead of replacing it, I opted to replace it with this oven. This oven works perfectly! It does what it says and more. The air fryer is wonderful for those frozen items and potatoes and the rotisserie works a treat. I’ve used it for baking as well, though I have had adjust cooking times. It will overcook if I follow the instructions on the packet. It is easy to clean and looks aesthetically pleasing in my kitchen. Highly recommend.",5
"Over the years I had several air fryers/ovens/toasters including a Kalorik none of them can measure up with the Emeril Lagasse air fryer 360. Precise temperature on all fonctions, easy to use and clean.We just love this oven which is larger than most.Great purchase!!",5
"I had a slightly smaller model of a different brand that had a plastic outside case and door and it broke into pieces and the door feel off from poor quality plastic.This is all metal and glass except for small non structural pieces on the handle.The only downside is the door can get a bit hot from being made of metal. Be careful not to burn yourself. I think it will last longer as a result though. And it works great.My model came with the grilling plate and I love it.The drip tray is removable and catches crumbs well, but to help keep the inside clean for many types of cooking, I also recommend getting third party stainless steel 12.5x9.5 inch baking pans that come with raised baking grills. It will let the air fryer circulate while catching more significant amounts of sauce and greasy drips.",5
Awesome product…… cooks amazing,5
"Good quality, warm, and soft",5
"The measurements in the listing are very accurate. However, you should check your measurements to the measurements in the listing. The pics will have you thinking this will drape the floor. On a twin the sides hang down about 12-1/2"" and 25"" at the foot with this laying flat on the mattress. It is all about personal preference. Depending on bed size, height, and other factors I have gone up or down a size.This is a great quilt with the look of a bedspread.It is very soft and comfortable and I slept under it all the way through the past couple of nights, something I rarely do.I washed and dried it according to the care instructions and it held up just fine with no shrinkage or wrinkles after immediately taking it out of the drier.Great product. Great value.",5
"I recently requested the Velvet King / Cal King Size, Black Quilt Set, and it has truly transformed my bedroom. The dual-sided velvet is incredibly soft and adds a touch of elegance to the room. The heavyweight feel of the quilt provides warmth and comfort, making it perfect for chilly nights.The box-stitched design not only looks stylish but also ensures that the down-alternative fill stays in place, providing consistent comfort. I appreciate that the set is machine washable, which makes it easy to keep clean and fresh.One of the standout features is the rich black color, which adds a sophisticated touch to my decor. The quilt and matching pillow shams are well-made and durable, promising to last through many washes without losing their softness.Overall, this quilt set is a fantastic addition to any bedroom. It's perfect for anyone looking to add a touch of luxury and comfort to their home. Highly recommend!",5
"This Great Bay Home velvet quilt set in navy is a dream come true for anyone who loves a touch of luxury with their comfort! Right away, I could feel the ultra-soft velvet material—it’s incredibly cozy and has a nice, comforting weight that makes it perfect for cold nights. The dual-sided velvet feels extra plush and indulgent, so no matter which side I’m snuggled under, it’s like being wrapped in a cloud.The heavyweight, down-alternative fill is another plus, providing warmth without overheating. The box-stitching is not only elegant but also keeps the fill evenly distributed, so there are no cold spots or clumping. The navy color is rich and deep, adding a sophisticated look to my room while remaining neutral enough to match various decor styles.For anyone looking to elevate their bedroom with a bedding set that’s as functional as it is luxurious, this quilt set is an absolute winner. It’s a perfect blend of style, comfort, and warmth—exactly what I wanted for a cozy night’s sleep!",5
"Wow, I'm so stoked about this quilt set!First, the color is a beautiful, bright brown. It almost has a slight gold sheen to it. It's also incredibly soft to the touch and the velvet is a fine, smoother velvet. It's great thickness, warm, and feels truly luxurious!",5
Love this Yankee candle! I think Yankee candles are the best as far as scent goes. This balsam and cedar candle reminds me of Christmas. It just makes me smile when I smell it. And Yankee candles last a long time too. I prefer jar candles because they are so much neater and do not drip. I’ve never had any glass breakage with one. Just be sure to trim the wick to a quarter inch every time you light it.,5
So I bought this because I thought it would smell like a christmas tree. To me it doesn't smell like a christmas tree but what I will say is that this is the first ever candle that to me smells like warmth and home. That was the only way I could think to describe it is warm. UPDATE so I decided today I was gonna just leave the lid off and since I have it smells more and more like christmas!,5
"Yankee candles are the best, but I hate their original jars. They look so dated, like they belong in Grandma’s house. The 22oz tumbler is a welcome change. The two-wick candle burns evenly across the top. To ensure this, on the first burn, allow the candle wax to liquify across the entire surface. Don’t extinguish it before that, otherwise you’ll never get an even burn.Trim wicks before each new burn & always burn long enough to liquify the entire surface. You’ll never have puddle burns, again.The fragrance of this candle is like a nice forest of fresh fir trees. 🌲 It’s not too strong, but just right.This candle is unbeatable for the Christmas season.",5
Smells amazing. I love that they burn slow and are not over powering. Yankee candles are the best!,5
"This is a true Yankee Candle! It's just as advertised and the smell is very nice... Pleasant, calming.Would definitely buy again. The price was a bargain!",5
"For me, this is the best candle there is. Yankee Candle always delivers on scent, and this festive candle just always makes me think of Christmas and wintertime. It has a nice long burn time, and I will always get one of these for the season.",5
Very nice fragrance that you can smell long burning,5
"I love candles and tried a lot but Yankees candles are the best . They smell great, and last long without any lighting problems.",5
Scent is just right - received within timeframe given,5
Aromas of Yankee candles are awesome 😎 and the enlarge candles smell good 😊,5
"These lights are AMAZING. The Govee app has plenty of preset lighting options/ colors but you can also customize your own. I have two sets and they are EXTREMELY bright for what they are. Definitely help lighting my living room. My only gripe is the adhesive tape they include to mount these panels to the wall leave much to be desired. I’ve had about three panels fall off and had to replace the adhesive. Overall not a big deal. Very happy with my purchase, I only wish I could buy more!",5
Really neat and easy to install. It feels solid and you really do have to put some pressure on the center. I found that once they stick decently I could pull them off and press further on the center for good measure. Overall it looks great and Installation was super easy. I love how adjustable the colors are on a whim. Totally worth everything and fun to play around with. The App was also easy to install and updated the profile to whatever layout you pick.,5
"lets start, these lights are very pretty and ate pretty decent sized. I used all 10 lights and they are very bright and the app is simple. DONT HESITATE TO BUY THEM. Although it did take a bit to install it was definitely worth it.",5
"I cannot stress this enough. Please do yourself a favor and watch the instructional video before you attempt to assemble them lol. These lights are better than the nanoleaf lights I bought prior, I can light each panel a separate color and the app made designing a layout a breeze. My only complaint would be the panels are a bit too tight in the wall mount, so it pulled the adhesive right off the wall (along with some paint and a portion of the drywall). This, of course, could have been avoided if I had taken my own advice and watched the instructional video before assembling. The panels are slightly smaller than the nanoleaf brand, so I was able to fit a bigger design on my small space that I wasn't able to do with the nanoleaf panels.",5
"***UPDATE: I was blown away by the Govee customer support after reaching out to them explaining the issue. They were extremely quick to respond (within about an hour) to my inquiry and immediately took steps to rectify my problem. They sent me a replacement that arrived in less than 48 hours, and the adhesive on this batch seems much better after setting them up. I was extremely impressed with the customer service and as I stated in my original review, the actual lights are beautiful. This has made me confident to continue purchasing and recommending Govee's products to friends and family.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I hate to write this review, as I love all of my other Govee products, but this really was a disappointing purchase. I have bought near $1000 of Govee lights over the past couple months and this is the first one that really was a terrible experience.As for the lights themselves, they are absolutely gorgeous. And the actual instructions for setup were fairly easy so no problems there. But oh god, the adhesion I would give a 0/10 if I could. I spent about an hour perfectly planning out my design, measuring for perfect placement, and very meticulously leveling each light panel as I followed the instructions on sticking them to the wall. In the morning I carefully cleaned the wall with isopropyl alcohol just to make sure there was no residue on the walls, then in the evening when it was time to actually install the hexa lights, I followed the instructions and wiped the wall with a dry cloth and then for each light I applied pressure for 60 seconds just to be safe. As I finished getting all the panels up and calibrated, one of the hex lights came unstuck. I wiped the wall again where that specific one fell off, reattached it, and went to sleep. Overnight, 2 of the 10 lights fell off the wall and were disconnected. 3 of the remaining 8 on the wall were not attached, but were just hanging from the support of some of the other lights.This whole installation has been a disaster from the start and has been an horrible user experience, which is a shame because the light quality for these themselves are great. So now I have to make the decision if I need to go and pay out of pocket to buy a bunch of command strips and reinstall all of these completely over again, or I am going to return them. I still haven't decided, but I wanted to provide this as a warning to all others looking to purchase this particular light.",5
"The media could not be loaded. One of my favorite products, the size and quality is solid. The mounting and serting of your design is much simpler than what I saw through the videos. The configuration is pretty quick. Just have a cleR design on mind or lay them on the carpet and play around until you get the right configuration for you. The colors are super and the panels are Super Super bright. On the pictures and video they were set at less than 5% because otherwize the reflect of the light doesnt allow you to take a clear picture or video.My only call out is that you will have extra "" cable"" between each panel connection as expected so you can have wiggle room, however the panels aren't heavy and the adhesive is pretty averga so depsite that I did spent 30 second pressing each one, as requested in the instructions. However, after a day or two de bending extra cord hidden in the back and the ""average"" adhesive, does not held the hexagons in place. them very well so it end up adding an extra double sided tape so they could stick nicely.Love the quality, size, functionalities,and price its a great product! Go grab yours!",5
I've had these for over 2 years. Really happy with them. I have quite a bunch of Govee products and these (and the smart plugs) are probably my favourite! Assembly was easier than it seemed also. I recommend!,5
"PRO's: Absolutely awesome, so many different configurations and boy do they ever get bright,, so much so that I have to keep them turned down to 20% at the highest, mind you my whole room is full of different Govee lighting on every wall.Super easy to use from the app with so many different colour patterns to choose from who of course you can DIY and works with T1 and T2 display systems, are RGBIC so you can get pure white out of them up to 6500 K or down to around 3000 I believe.Super easy doing install and comes with many suggestions on patterns or of course you can choose your own, so many options with the assignable LEDs inside each hex, let alone the combination of them working in harmony. Great value as they often go on sale for 40% off or so and are much better value than Phillips lighting without trading off any quality, in fact in my opinion it's superior in most cases.CON's: (TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE)",5
"Take your time, do the design on the floor before you tape to the wall. Measure 3 xs to make sure you get it right. The apps is awesone. Easy to understand. Like anything if you have experiance with electronics you will be fine. If your a NOOB just take your time and you will succeed.I purchased a grey cover from amazon to hide the white cord.Its VERY bright when you turn it up. I will light up the room for sure.Works with google home no probs.You have UNLIMITED designs, just leave it to you imagination.",5
"I have to agree with other reviewers, the fragrance and the strength of the smell is just about perfect for what I need. I placed this on my entryway bench and when you sit to put on shoes or you're getting the dogs collars and leashes ready, it gives off a pleasant smell. But it's not so strong that I smell it all the time or can't burn a candle in the living room without the smells competing. I will likely purchase another one, maybe 2, for other small spaces in the house. Great value, too, since you get the extra fragrance bottle.",5
"Beautiful item that is appealing not only to the eye, but fills a large room with a fresh, light, yet masculine scent that smells almost seductive. The glass jar comes pre filled, yet also includes a large bottle for refills. My entire family has complimented the scent, in a room that usually has an odor of dogs (being my two large dogs sleep in our bedroom). It is strong, yet not overpowering. I cannot image I will get tired of the scent as it is that good. 10/10- will be purchasing again!",5
Smells great and lasts long,5
I'll order again next time,5
"This Gonjahon Reed Diffuser Set is a pleasant-smelling reed diffuser with a whole lot of essential oil. There is a main glass bottle which apparently has about 112ml of essential oil and a plastic refill bottle with 200ml more for a total of 10.55 fluid ounces of essential oil. The sales listing mentions the essential oil should last about 120 days or 4 months. And the set comes with 10 black reeds or “rattan diffusion bars.” The smell reminds me of a gentle cologne which apparently is labeled as “early morning.”There is not much for instructions. The box shows removing the reeds and flipping them apparently every 48hours. But beyond that, there is nothing more except for a lot of Chinese Kanji.This is a good essential reed diffuser set. And the glass bottle is elegant enough to place out in the open for guests to admire. As to whether this would turn out to be your favorite fragrance, that is hard to predict since everyone’s taste is different. But it is a gentle, pleasant scent that most people would likely enjoy.",5
"I recently installed the BAYKA Floating Shelves in my guest bathroom, and they’ve been a game-changer! Here’s why:Perfect for Small SpacesSince my bathroom doesn't have cabinets, I needed a way to store extra toilet paper and other bathroom essentials. These shelves are ideal! They fit perfectly on the wall without taking up too much space, and they gave me the extra storage I was looking for without overcrowding the room.Great Rustic LookThe rustic wood finish on these shelves looks fantastic. It adds a warm, charming touch to the bathroom, which is exactly what I wanted. The natural wood grain blends really well with my bathroom’s decor, making it feel cozy and stylish.Easy to InstallInstalling these shelves was super easy. The instructions were clear, and it only took about 15 minutes to get them up on the wall. The mounting hardware was included, so I didn’t need anything extra, and they’re securely attached now.Sturdy and FunctionalDespite their sleek design, these shelves are really sturdy. I’ve got toilet paper, hand towels, and some decorative items on them, and they’re holding everything just fine. No wobbling or issues with weight at all.Great ValueFor the price, these shelves are a steal. They look more expensive than they are and add so much character to the space. Plus, they’ve freed up some much-needed counter space in the bathroom.Overall, I’m really happy with the BAYKA Floating Shelves. They’re stylish, practical, and easy to install—perfect for adding storage to small spaces. If you need some extra room in your bathroom or any other room, I highly recommend these!",5
These are made of good quality material. They were easy to install. Look great and the finish was nice. Yes I would buy these again.,5
Exactly as advertised. Very easy to install and the shelves come with everything you need to hang them. ( screws and anchors) They look very nice on the wall.,5
"My room is really small so I needed a way to make space and make it look clean. I have a ton of books so I decided to get these floating shelves and it looks so beautiful! I really love the shelves. My dad did help me install them. You definitely need a measuring tape, a drill, and some patience. It wasn’t the super easiest to install but it wasn’t bad either. Worth the money for sure",5
"Thanks to the reviews here, I purchased metal plaster anchors to install. Much sturdier. This is easy to install. Get yourself some metal anchors first. Amazon sells them too.",5
Love this candle warmer! Its a great size and works so well. Very attractive design that could look good in any room in the house and works with several decor styles. I like that it has a timer and the light does radiate a nice glow. It does have an adjustable pole to accomodate candle height.,5
"I first encountered one of these at a boutique and so glad I did! It is attractively made and works so well with any type of jar candle. It also makes a great night light and as an added bonus emits a great smell from the candle. No more worries about starting a fire! I have given these as gifts and received so many thank-yous! That speaks volumes about the product, that's for sure!",5
The glass lampshade is vey pretty and the lamp seems to be well constructed. The light bulb melts the candles quickly. The timer is a nice safety feature.,5
"We absolutely LOVE this candle warmer that we got for our housewarming present! It's so much safer than burning candles and in my opinion, the scent stays longer and steadier than a live flame. And while it might not be as cozy as a flickering flame, it is so much safer for our home. We have a child who always has friends over, and the candle is always a concern - we don't want kids burning themselves, and now we don't have to worry about it. The candle warmer escapes notice. I did notice this size of candle warmer works best with single wick candles or smaller candles - I think I would need a bigger one for three wick candles, but that's fine. I think this also helps the candle last longer as well!",5
"Works like a charm. This adjustable lamp makes it easy to adjust for different size candles. While it works for fragrance, it also has ample brightness needed in the area just like a candle. I like the option to control brightness, which you can’t really do with a simple candle.",5
"I adore this candle warmer! I was looking for a way to help reduce some unpleasant scents in my office at work (joys of being located near a loading dock in a large city) and I didn’t feel comfortable with an open flame because I often have to leave my office to address issues in other departments. I love that this gives me a safe way to use my candle stash and that it does so in such a pretty way! People stop in to comment on the great smell from the candles it melts and ask me where I got this great little lamp. I also love the timer feature because if I forget to turn it off before I leave for the night, I know it will shut off on its own!I love that this lamp has an adjustable height to work with any size candle and that it helps my candles last longer than traditional burning! 10/10 on all fronts!",5
Just as pictured! Works very well and it’s nice you get an extra light bulb. The timer setting is amazing! Very happy with my purchase.,5
"These shower racks are sturdy, the construction wire is thick! The racks are so spacious I was able to use them for 2 showers. They were easy to put them up and the adhesive is so strong. My showers walls are fiberglass.",5
"We ordered these a few month back for our standing shower. I was expecting to have to anchor these to the tiles with screws, but the adhesive backing is far stronger than i ever expected. The clips are mounted to a singular plate that fits behind the baskets and really provides support. Due to the design, the clips all contact the baskets evenly and spread the weight all the way across. It took longer to prep the surface than it did to install the baskets. Start to finish install was under 5 min total and they have held up perfectly.",5
"These are wonderful. It was super easy to install, didn't break the bank, they look wonderful. I love how it's not suction cups! The adhesive sticks super well!! I have those bulk giant bottles, they fit perfectly and nothing has fallen, kids haven't torn them down. I'm very happy with this purchase! Follow directions, clean your walls, once it sticks.... It's not moving so be careful. Great value!",5
"I love these ""shelves"" so much I bought 2 more! I have them in both of our showers and bought the 3rd for my parents' shower! The finish (black) looks great. Easy to install - just have to be able to wait 24 hrs to put the shelves on. They hold quite a bit and dont feel like they will fall off the tiles. I am using the one thats supposed to be for toothbrushes?? for my combs, etc in the shower and it works out so well. I definitely give this a 2 thumbs up!!!",5
"The only negative I have is, if you've got an apartment sized tub/shower these might be too wide and you'll end up bumping into them with elbows or any body part that's aligned with where you've installed them. However, that's not a design flaw, therefore I didn't take away any stars. They seem to be very sturdy and has great stickiness (I did thoroughly clean the shower walls, rinsed them well, then wiped the areas I was placing the hangers with alcohol. Then I heated the hangers with my blow dryer, used a butter knife to make sure I got around every edge. Then I waited a full 24+ hours to attach the baskets and put items in them. I have huge salon sized shampoo and conditioner bottles with pumps that withhold their weight and me pumping to get the product. I really REALLY want to love these, but having to contort my body every shower is annoying. I will see if they have replacement sticky adhesives and if changing positions would work (shower walls have 2 ""seams"" that stick out, so I don't have unlimited space).",5
"We just renovated our tub/shower surround and it didn't come with shelves, so we needed a solution - hence this purchase. I used a level and frog tape to get these exactly where I wanted them, then lifted the clear panel up and carefully removed the backing, keeping the frog tape on as a guide. Pressed down firmly, then let the adhesive cure overnight before putting the shelves up. It feels like these aren't going anywhere. The install was so easy and perfect. They hold a ton of weight and feel very sturdy. The instructions say warranty is 2 years, so that's encouraging! I will report back if they fail.",5
"These shelves are great. Very study, attractive and the adhesive WORKS! Nice storage, easy to install. Very pleased with product and worth the cost which was very reasonable.",5
"Batteries included, how great is that. I set the timer and they come on automatically every evening. Made very sturdy and easy to use. The flickering lights are very real looking. They are perfect.",5
"These flameless candles are a fantastic addition to any home! They offer the ambiance of real candles without the worry of an open flame, making them perfect for households with children or pets, or for anyone who wants to enjoy candlelight without the fire hazard. The flickering flame effect is incredibly convincing, mimicking the gentle dance of a real candle flame. This creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. They are made of real wax which enhances the realistic look and feel. The timer function adds convenience, allowing you to set the candles to turn on and off automatically at your preferred times. The remote control makes it easy to operate them from a distance, even across the room. No more worries about accidentally knocking over a candle or leaving it unattended. These flameless candles offer the perfect blend of beauty, functionality, and peace of mind. Highly reccomended!",5
"Luminara candles are the best ever. The flickering flame is so realistic! - More than any other I've purchased. It creates the best ambiance, especially during the fall/winter/Christmas season. The battery life is good, the remote control works great. The only negative is the price. 🫤 I wish they weren't SO expensive. Because of that, I hesitated getting them. But -I'm glad I did!",5
I love the Luminaire real flame candle trio and it includes a ready to use remote. A beautiful burgundy color great for any season or occasion. A great value and excellent quality.,5
"These are terrific, look like real candles. The outside is real wax. Working perfectly. I use them every night. I have two sets of three, total of six. Great for the living room. I can operate all six from one remote control.",5
"I’ve wanted to buy these candles for a long time. They were pricey, but they are lovely.I wish I would have bought them years ago. They give off a beautiful flickering glow. The control makes it easy to turn on and off.",5
Love the remote and realistic flickering Beautiful addition to our room.,5
These lights emit a cozy light to any room,5
The perfect decor for the perfect fan. Three cute shadowboxes with baseball slogans-perfect,5
"These are well constructed and look very high-quality. We use these to decorate the cake table at my son’s sports themed birthday party. However, he has now commandeered them and has them as decorations in his room.",5
These signs are well made and very cute. The sayings are perfect for baseball season and have blended well with the other baseball themed decor that I have.,5
Such fun summer decor for my home!,5
"Ordered the baseball set. My 10 yo is having an amazing season on All-stars this summer. This is a small is size set of 3 nesting boxes. While they aren't huge and would awkward hanging on a wall, they will look super cute on a shelf, desk, or dresser. As he plays baseball all year long with Fall Ball, Sprink Ball, and now All-stars, these will be able to be displayed all year long.",5
"If your a child of the 80’s-90’s “You’re killing me smalls” was a part of your vocabulary and might still be. When I saw these, I just couldn’t resist! Will pair perfectly with 4th if July decor and make me smile whenever I see it.",5
"These are the perfect little decorations For summer. It’ll work for Memorial Day, during Fourth of July and carry me through the summer. They are made really well and stagger in sizes. The print is adorable and printed on clearly. Totally worth the values.",5
Perfect for my front door the magnets stay on great nice and light weight but great quality and there are so many changeable attachments for all the seasons and holidays,5
Purchased this as a housewarming gift for our good friends and they loved it! I was honestly shocked at how good the quality of the sign and adorable different interchangeable holiday pieces it comes with. Literally couldn’t have exceeded my expectations more. It’s the perfect housewarming gift and a total steal for the price it’s set at. Could not recommend this adorable sign more!! Worth every penny!,5
So cute!!! Great quality! Perfect for our new home!,5
"Finally starting to get into our new place and finally being able to put up signs that we picked out and that are ours alone was a feeling we thought we'd brush over. Honestly it feels amazing to have a place that's ours. It does tend to wobble but it doesn't really fall off if you secure it right, the pieces stay on and everything, lovely signage!",5
"I love it the fact that I can switch the welcome sign according to the season! Not sure if its a good size for the main entrance door, I use it on the side door near my car garage which is the door that we use the most. great quality and get a lot of compliments.",5
"This was super cute! The quality was good. It was lightweight and looked nice. The greenery at the top was a little sparse and looked a tad fake but overall it was a great value for the cost, and from the front door it doesn’t look fake/bad a distance. The changeable pieces are cute and there are a variety of holiday options as well!",5
Looks very nice,5
"Colorful, good quality stones. When opened looks beautiful, perfect size to fit any where. Adds beauty, and tranquility to any room.",5
"I received a handcrafted Tree of Life for as a gift from my son. I am very impressed with the colors and meaningful thought put behind this tree. I was also very impressed to receive a card from Neha (who made this beautiful tree). Neha is from Rajkot (India) and tells a bit about herself as well as her children and goals. Not only did I receive a very unique gift, but the proceeds are helping those striving to make a better life for themselves and their family.",5
"I’ve been wanting one of these for a while. I love the size it’s perfect, it’s small and this fits in my decor. The stones are a beautiful color and I love the personal note that was attached with my purchase.",5
My boyfriend got me this as a gift and it is super cute. the bottom is heavy enough to it stand its ground. it was really easy and almost therapeutic spreading the branches apart,5
I gave this to my wife for her birthday and she absolutely loves it!! Excellent hand made quality!!,5
Just as described. Fits well on my wall unit,5
"Beautiful, good quality, arrived very quickly.",5
"Very nice tree of life. It has helped me in various situations like health, money, harmony. I believe in that and the tree is beautiful.",5
put them around the house,5
"I couldn't be happier with this adorable turtle statue! It adds the perfect touch of charm to my garden. The design is incredibly detailed, and the succulent on its back looks so realistic. I love how the 7 LED lights illuminate the statue beautifully at night, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere in my yard. It's solar-powered, so it's completely hassle-free—just set it up and enjoy! This tortoise statue makes a fantastic gift idea or a lovely addition to any outdoor space. Highly recommend!",5
"The Nacome Solar Garden Turtle is a delightful addition to any garden or patio. Here’s why I love it:Eco-Friendly Solar Lantern: Powered by clean energy from the sun, this turtle statue features a rechargeable 1.2V AAA 300mAH Ni-MH battery. During the day, it soaks up sunlight, and at night, it emits a warm glow from its 7 LED lights.Perfect Size: Standing at 21.5 cm wide and 12.5 cm high, this turtle makes a charming impression wherever you place it—whether on the balcony, patio, lawn, or even a wide window sill.Easy to Use: Simply turn the figurine on and leave it in the “on” position during the daytime.

"Got this as a gift for my mom and she LOVES it to this day! It’s a beautiful piece that adds character anywhere you put it. She has it in her bay window and at night it acts as a night light. Small and lightweight, this little decor is adorable as a gift!",5
This looks beautiful in my yard. Works great at night with solar charging and has a strong built for cold weather. Very lightweight and good priced.,5
"It’s a little bit hard to see because it’s not very dark, but I bought myself these for my birthday and I absolutely love them. The darker it is the cuter they are.",5
This turtle garden decoration is super cute! I love it!,5
He’s perfect for watching over my garden at night. Very bright too!,5
"This is beautiful and so well made and the detail is amazing .It looks so great, and when it’s lit up it just gets better .Took its first good hard rain today and it didn’t bother it at all. Nothing came off in the storm and I couldn't be happier .Being solar powered is the way to go!My backyard is lit up like a Christmas tree, all solar powered .Im looking forward to buying many more of these from this company.

The computer was very easy to set up. Once I set it up and started using it it was very fast. Very satisfied with my purchase and going to purchase another one for my sister.,5
"***There Was No Compensation For This Review******EDITED REVIEW**I've officially owned this machine for over 2 months now. All I can say is WOW. The negativity following this machine makes me wonder if these are other issues that could be causing problems versus the machine.. I read a review *Top Critic* and it sounds more of an internet connection issue versus the machine. The capability of this machine has been amazing. I use this machine now mainly for gaming/fun. I have 3 monitors with peripherals setup (mouse, keyboard, microphone, headset), and have no issues with connectivity or software issues. The machine can handle me streaming on two different platforms and in the same action playing a high demanding game on ULTRA settings and a recording software going at the same time. My GPU is still only around 70-80% and the CPU is running amazing. The cooling of this machine is great and have not had 1 issue since purchase. I would take the critic/negativity reviews carefully.. Don't let those scare you away.. You COULD end up with possibly something wrong but that could've also been from shipping or anything.. If you're looking for a budget PC that can perform very well, than I HIGHLY recommend this PC. Hope this helps!----------------------------------------------------------------Original review belowTo start off, this is a review on the item:Manufacturer Part#: ST-NEBULA-0819-B-AMProcessor: INTEL Core i5 13400F 2.5 GHz (4.6GHz Max Boost) CPUMemory: 16GB DDR4 RAM 3200 Gaming Memory with Heat SpreaderVideo Card: NVIDIA Geforce RTX 4060 8GB GDDR6X Graphics Card (Brand may vary)SSD: 1TB NVME SSDOperating System: Microsoft windows 11 Home 64-bitCase: Skytech Nebula Gaming Case, BlackWiFi: 802.11ACFans: 4 RGB Fans for Maximum Air FlowThis PC so far has been great for gaming as well as working from home. The functionality right out of the box has been great and it has been a breeze to get setup. The PC has a folder that comes with it and it shows the step by step guide on how to setup your machine as well as how to troubleshoot if need be. There are many Pro's and few Con's so far since I have owned the Machine.Pros:Packaging for shipping was over the top on making sure it was coming to me securely,Comes as described with little setup needed,Performance has been stellar,Quiet Machine and fans,Case has great airflow,Quality of the product is over the top for the price of this machine.Operates many games on ULTRA settings with 0 issues.Cons:The machine comes with 16gb of DDR4 ram installed and this is a great starter amount but for full potential I would recommend upgrading to the minimum of 32gb of DDR4 or higher.(I upgraded to 32gb DDR4 3200mhz with the 4 available slots)One of the Ram sticks seemed to be not fully clipped into position but took minor adjustment to get setup.The rear fan was loose and rubbing against the case which had a small clicking noise but was an easy fix.Trouble connecting the DisplayPort to a Monitor after trying multiple cords, but HDMI does work well.Cord management inside could be much better, the cables seem to block some of the ports for the RAM and would recommend using some zip-ties to hold them out of the way.Games:GTA-V - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSFortnite - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSBattlefield 2042 - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSWar Thunder - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSMinecraft - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPSCan handle many applications open on multiple monitors when working from home such as, Tableau, Excel, Zoom, Teams, Talend, PowerPoint, Multiple query applications (Coding with no issues), Video editing, Streaming.The PC at the price point is worth the purchase, after doing many researches without wanting to build my own PC this was the best Pre-Built machine money can find. Many have i5-13400F processors with 3060's or lower processors with similar 4060/3060's for more cost. At $850 USD this machine will tackle most of what you will need to do unless you're into heavy editing or a big streamer or using extreme applications. This PC is great for overall use.",5
"Ordered this PC from a store called MXC tech because it was on sale it turned out that place was a scam (MAKE SURE TO ORDER IF IT IS SHIPPED AND SOLD BY AMAZON.COM)Been using a decently old laptop GTX 1650 and I5 12450H reason I bought this was because someone broke my main. The jump from those computers to this is actually incredible I’ve never had a computer with an RTX Series card.To the main lighting, when pressing the RGB button it will download the program all RGB in the case is customizable and bright. The size is pretty small the width is a little chunky not going to like but overall smallish pc. Do not let the size fool you it’s powerful I’ve played 3 games on it so far I will give my FPS and stats during using itFortnite - epic settings direct x12 I was running about 60-70 FPS it had a few stutters but that is normal I would say.Went to performance mode on all medium settings ran a constant 238-240 FPS kn the ground while deploying from the battle bus it stuttered a little at the start then eased on, temps never went over 60°C on the GPU. I do keep my room quite cold so that can maybe affect it a little bit.Rainbow six siege - ran around 300 fps I capped it to 240 as it wasnt the most consistent when it was unlimited frames. Constant 999 FPS while in the menu lol.Roblox - anywhere from 140+ depending on the game using max graphics.The keyboard that came with it I didn’t use but it looked like some good build quality.Mouse that came with I didn’t try either.I had 0 issues so far with the computer booted right up I was worried but to my shock nothing went wrong this is my first day using it and it works super good.The value for this computer is really good the parts all together is around $850-$900 so it’s a steal.**Again I rebought this computer from shipped and sold by Amazon.com even if it looks like a good deal do not buy it.**Came with 3 display ports and 1 HDMI on the graphics card.No issue with startup it was simple and easy pressed a few buttons logged in and that was it.Overall this pc is a pretty good computer especially for its price I recommend buying it if you don’t want to break your wallet with prices of computers these days.",5
Got it for about $700 with tax with the black friday deal. I didn't have a big budget and this was definitely an upgrade over my 8 year old lenovo laptop. I'm happy so far. The improvement is noticeable and it can play all the games I want well. 1080 and 60 fps. It is still early but I hope it lasts a few years. if it doesn't I'll be sure to update the review.,5
"You truly cannot find something this capable at this price point anywhere else. Trust me. Between the processor, graphics card, and RAM it's a steal. I have used it for 2 weeks so far and am impressed with the speed and gaming capabilities. It can easily handle most games. It has a cool looking case and is solid. Couldn't be happier with my purchase!",5
"My gaming computer celebrated its 12th birthday recently and informed me that it was ready to retire. I have had a Nitro 5 laptop for a couple of years and have been impressed with it, so when a decent deal showed up on Prime day I bought the Nitro 50. It runs MSFS20, TSW5 and most of my older games. And runs them well, I loaded one of the original Railworks routes in Train Simulator Classic and had frame rates in triple digits. Newer, denser routes still had decent frame rates, but everything ran smoothly without any lagging. Other than the differences between Win10 and Win11, the changeover has been smooth and setup was easy. So far I like it.",5
"I bought this to be a 1080 gaming rig and also bought a 120hz monitor to go with it. I have played world of Warcraft, Diablo 4 and final fantasy XIV on high settings with no problems. Temps are within normal range and I’m playing it on balanced power settings. You should get a better mouse for this pc, the one it comes though works but feels cheap. There is an extra m.2 drive in it and it came with cables to connect a ssd ad well which I did both with no problems. So far I’m happy.",5
"This is the first 'store bought', pc that I've bought in 40 years. Simply put, I couldn't build a pc with these specs for the price Acer sells it for. The only mod that I might do is up the ram from 16G to 32G. This thig just works great. I'm coming from an AMD FX 4.2ghz rig that I built in 2016. It never missed a beat on win10, but it was time to give the old one up. I'm still getting used to the intel CPU throttling, but what a PC for the money!",5
"Packaging was excellent, double layers of boxes and foam, and included several custom foam inserts both around and within the case itself to hold all the parts and GPU securely during transit. No wires arrived loose, no ports were bent or damaged, everything was very plug-and-play. While I have my own peripherals already, the included keyboard/mouse performed well when tested and were comfortable to use, and could easily serve as primary peripherals for anyone not looking to spend extra coin on more hardware.Device performs as expected per its specifications - crushing any modern video game title (from Cyberpunk to Helldivers and beyond) with high FPS on maxed out settings, and handles taxing digital workspace functions very well (complex Blender renders, very large Photoshop files, etc). It leaves almost nothing to be desired - anything you might want to play or build, the machine can handle excellently. While not the absolute bleeding edge of current market hardware, this is still clearly a very powerful machine which delivers top-end performance without demanding top-end budgeting.This is my first serious step up from a long line of ""gaming laptops,"" which generally performed adequately but would often show their limitations (especially heat tolerance) under high load. With a large, open, very ventilated case, an impressive suite of fans servicing the GPU and parts from almost every angle, and a direct cooling mount for the CPU, this model has thus far showed no such limitations, and has handled extended play or work sessions in settings like Blender and VRchat without throttling.The case design is fantastic and will make any future cleaning and servicing incredibly easy and convenient - with but a push of a button, both glass panels release and can be opened out like a cabinet, providing immediate access for air dusting or any future part installation. No screws, no snaps, no wrestling with metal plates - just push a single button and you're in. RBG is pretty - I bought this machine for work, not aesthetics, but it does look nice, all the fans and the RAM light up and you can customize it pretty thoroughly. Adds flair without being overbearing.While many PC junkies will sing endless praises of ""building your own"" frankenmachine, I frankly didn't want to waste countless hours researching parts and then stumbling through the nightmare of wiring and assembling everything myself (and facing god knows how many unforeseen troubleshooting obstacles along the way). This machine gave me all the performance I needed in one concise, easy to setup package, and based on its specifications, should hopefully serve me well for years to come.One extra note, though - the Amazon delivery process for this product was not professional and could have very easily resulted in high cost theft. The requested discrete packaging was not used at all (maybe Amazon just didn't have the necessary combination of large box + packaging foam...?), and the driver ditched the package (which very visibly advertises its contents) in front of my apartment and then signed for me himself without even bothering to knock. Thankfully I was watching my door like a hawk that day, and got the package inside immediately - but had I been away at work or errands or some such, this might have been a much sorrier tale. If you spring for this item, make sure to request its delivery on a day when you're free and can immediately receive it. Amazon staff cannot be trusted to respect the packaging and signature process.",5
"Firstly the pictures don't really give it justice. The case is beautiful. The entire glad part opens up like a cabinet without a brave in the center. I play Star Citizen religiously and I'm getting between 70 and 155 FPS on a game that has 0% optimization like a champ. Highly recommend this product. On bad thing to say is the box was damaged upon arrival with only damage to the included keyboard which so works but it is bent like an arch which is surprising since the packaging was insane. Also having some trouble with the top and rear case fans rgb. This is minor, and can be addressed with customer support and does not hinder any operations in any way. Skytech knocked it out of the park. Only thing I will be doing is upgrading the basic case fans.",5
This is a very good PC,5
"High end gamer here, and I've been running this for about 2 months now I think, and I have zero complaints, not a single game so far has even stuttered, and I play some pretty poorly optimized games. Box actually showed up a little damaged, but the protective packaging protected it just fine.",5
"If you follow me you know i give it straight forwards. My son is a gamer, coder, programmer. Its super fast. It does the job. Yes it will need alot of updates he had over 100 that needed done. Yes could use another stick ram. Supports oculus quest 2. Meaning he can go into another room and use his oculus through his system, can have all his online friends join him during that time ane even get calls through the computer to his oculus. They can all play together. Even in different countries. And he can do his home school work with his teachers in school online. This is best money spent.",5
I know I'm late on writing this but as soon as it came we installed but the next day we turn it on and it didn't work I can't remember what the screen said we just put it away and never got use again so just sitting there put away don't get me wrong is a nice peace but it just didn't workThank you.,5
Well I would definitely recommend this gaming system . My daughter loves it it’s very affordable and durable. The company is very nice and know how to take care of their customers I really appreciate the good customer service I would definitely would but again from this company.,5
its just a scam for ether little kids who like the rgb fans or boomers who dont know about computers overall its trashy slow and not good if you want a strong fast pc i put five stars so it could get to the top,5
terrible do not buy this pc cant run most games and i benchmarked it it couldnt even run the benchmark test i tried mc on it and it ran 50 frames on the easiest game i kno and thats with razers fps booster terrible for the money expand ur budget to like 600 dollars build ur own pc off yt and u can run about 150-200 frames on most games AGAIN DO NOT BUY THIS GO TO YOUTUBE AND GET HELP THERE TO BUILD UR OWN FOR 600,5
PC can play any game on 2k or 4k with ease. Incredibly fast boot time. Fans are somewhat loud. I don't use wifi while gaming so i don't know if that works well. Overall the PC is a very good deal and I am pleased with it. Would definitely recommend.,5
"Computer came packaged good, with everything in the box, with a really nice headset, keyboard, mouse, tower, monitor, can't get the headset to sync but I'm sure it's an easy fix. So far the computer is working great! My daughter LOVES it! Great price, awesome starter pc!! Perfect for gaming!! Fast to boot up, easy to set up!! Quiet pc!! Wifi capability!! Just pluged it in and it was ready in a few short steps!! NICE!!!",5
"For a beginner, this is really good for me! it was fairly easy to set up with a few YouTube searches. I'm using it for schoolwork and games that don't take up too much bandwidth. Roblox runs well, as well as minecraft! The monitor is similar to a small TV, but is pretty easy to set up. I would recommend this for any PC beginner!!",5
I’m 12 and this is the best thing I’ve ever bought off amazon,5
Wow! Great quality and value for money. The screen display is very big! The speed to set up and use amazing!Had a issue with PC but I contacted the seller and he was very helpful to fix the issue with the PC. PC is working fine and Playing games on the pc is very smooth and great graphics too.,5
"I didn't know what to expect for buying a new desktop after 20 years. Everything works great so far and should be good for a long, long time. Its a decent price and good for people who want to do business or make gaming content, i have yet to try out gaming with this desktop but it sounds REAL promising. I like the LEDs and having a set of headphones with mic, bonus. My only problem is that when opened the package, I didn't see any kind of manual, nor link, to assemble my set. Some people can do without it, but newbies like me would have trouble if they're not careful. For example: how to put my monitor together, I managed to put it together luckily, but can't tell if its supposed to be loose with this type of monitor. And another example is the HD port from the monitor: I thought I plug it on my tower but I cant do that lol, its the little things like that.But despite those minor issue, I still recommend buying this set if want for novices. Hope this helps.",5
This thing has cool colors and holds up well. was easy for a teenager to set up and install all by her self. would recommend. it is sturdy and no shipping issues either. but the box is heavy as expected,5
"This desk is easy to assemble following the instructions. You may want to wait to fully tighten all the fasteners until everything is assembled to ensure easy assembly. The 55” version is perfect for my needs and it looks great. The colored leds are a bonus. All in all it’s a very usable computer desk. My only negative is the shelf is too small for my tower. My fault for not checking the measurements more closely. Aside from that, I’d recommend this computer desk.",5
"The media could not be loaded. Absolutely what I expected! I've been searching for months for a new gaming desks and this desks was in my cart 5 times so I had to get it!! The LED lights were the perfect touch, as you can see lol. I ordered the desk and it was delivered literally the next day. Set up time was about an hour and a half. Directions were clear and all tools were included plus extra tools just in case. Great size for my set up space. I originally had a 40 inch desk and it was so small for all that I had on my desk. This 55 inch has so much room for all of my gaming/work needs and it's so sturdy!!! I just love it and I am happy that I got it! Get it NOW before it's in your cart 5 times too lol just get it and stop playing lol",5
I’ve been desk searching for a while now on amazon. I had an ikea 70 inch desk for 2 years and it was terrible after a long time. This desk is the perfect length and height. It has beautiful led lights with a variety of colors! (and sturdy!!)putting it together 9/10. I’ve never built a desk before and it was very easy to read the instructions and put together this desk. If you’ve got strong hands and arms then this should be super easy for you. I had to take breaks in between. 🤣 I recommend this desk to anyone.,5
"Not sure if I got the same desk as some of you in these comments lol. This Desk cost me like 100 bucks on sale and it's amazing. The quality is great, no issues putting it together unless you have no brain cells and great color. LEDs are crazy amazing and honestly, I don't see myself wanting or needing a new desk for a LONG time",5
"I purchased this desk for my son who is a hardcore gamer. When it came, he put it together with ease. The color and construction of the desk was very pleasing but on the L side because it has only 2 places for legs, if you tried to move it the L would start bowing in the middle. Has more than enough ports and charging outlets. Very spacious and sturdy, even on carpet. I would recommend this product for anyone to purchase. The desk is well worth the price.",5
"It was easy to put together, and it serves its purpose as a desk. The LED lights on it are so nice. Not really sure what people are talking about the desk being janky, but it's been great for me.",5
"Setup took roughly two hours by myself, simple instructions and comes with extra screws :) I attached the LED bar to the back of the ledge after reading comments and think it looks great! Multiple LED options and the outlet works functionally, desk seems decently sturdy. One note is the instructions don’t mention it, but the top shelf is supposed to be screwed in from the bottom. Overall would recommend 👍",5
It was easy to build and perfectly fits our needs.,5
"The media could not be loaded. I’ve always used the microphone from my computer or Bluetooth headset. With all the ZOOM meetings and working from home these days, I thought it be an opportunity to check out a higher quality mic. I saw these on Amazon and figured it was worth a try as it came with everything – stand, microphone, filters.Straight out of the box with a quick install, the mic worked just as advertised – 100% plug and play into my laptop. To check out the difference in audio quality, I opened up ZOOM and tested the mic. I tested the built-in laptop mic first and head it play back, then selected the new mic and listened to the play back. I was amazed at the difference!The computer mic sounds like you’re taking in an aluminum can. This USB condensing mic produces a full, rich voice recording. I was stunned at the difference. I can’t tell you how different it is from something like the YETI, but it’s worlds different than your computer mic. The set up is also quite convenient as you can push the mic away when not in use and pull it back to your face when you want to use it. Another great feature is that the mic is sensitive enough that it’ll pick up your voice as you look at your monitor and talk – you don’t have be shouting towards the mic.After a week or so of testing the mic, I also learned a few things to be aware of. 1) The mic is sensitive (as with all condensing microphones) so it will catch background noise (like a loud fan). 2) The stand could definitely use an upgrade. It’s great this comes with a stand, but I would say this is probably entry level or slightly better. It works just fine, but I notice that sometimes the mic starts to sag. You’ll have to tighten the finger screws a little once in a while. I did some research for better stands and they cost more than this entire set up alone. 3) You can mute/unmute the mic by holding down on the volume buttons. If you don’t hear anything for your recording, look for the blue light to confirm it’s on and hold down the volume button to unmute.Overall, the mic+stand set is great. The mic produces a rich, full sound and the stand works as intended. It’s 100% plug and play… all you have to do is set up and plug it in.",5
"I’ve never owned a real microphone until now, but boy oh boy I wish I had bought this sooner. Didn’t necessarily *need* one because my headset has a built in one but I have online college classes and didn’t want to wear a full out headset like a nerd. Mic has no feedback, no static, doesn’t cut in and out, and doesn’t require a lot of set up either! Another thing i really like is how clearly you can hear your voice, there is almost no background noise at all and it’s amazing.Be weary and plan ahead where you’re going to put the mic arm because the cable is maybe about 6-8ft long and if your pc is on the floor like mine it might not reach all the way to the side of your desk! (I have an L shaped desk, my PC is on the floor in the corner)",5
Works great,5
"Overall, this S with 1tb internal storage (and 1tb expansion card) is all I require for gaming. The video is outstanding, the audio running thru a 3.1 (and expandable) home entertainment system is very good, and response times are fine. Unless you are a high-octane gamer or absolutely have to have the physical disc drive, this console should be all you need. I highly recommend this.",5
This is my second Xbox series S. I had one before but due to the area I lived in had to get rid of it. I bought a new house and decided to buy another Xbox. I prefer the series S since it’s the digital one and I love the fact that it has a slim design. Never had any issues with either one and I have had the new one for a week and have already played 10 hours on it.,5
I gave this to my son for his birthday present he was so happy! I would recommend spending the extra money getting the 1 tb now to avoid an extra cost later on hard drive space.,5
"I was skeptical about switching to next gen, especially when I have ULTIMATE and can use cloud gaming. BROOOOOOOOOOO, let me say this: DO IT.Faster load times... LIKE SIGNIFICANTLYGames are beautiful... take a game like Fortnite, that's pretty basic... mannnn, Fortnite is lowkey a beautiful game on next-gen.Smooth, like butter graphics. I played The Division 2 last night and I felt like John Wick.The only thing was waiting for the first game to download. It was like an 80GB one.If you've got ULTIMATE, there's NO REASON to not buy a next gen console, the money you save on games, grab the upgrade. 4k (although not true 4k, but who's counting pixels) is amazing. My eyes actually need to adjust to the clarity. Lol.",5
Really love this system!! Best value for the money. It’s great you have a instant library right out of the box,5
Works well andis very clean!!!,5
"Works like new. Not a single scratch or scuff, very happy. Loved the no hassle financing, would love to see the same type no credit check financing. Would be awesome to have this option on more big ticket items.",5
I've always played Xbox growing up for hours a day. So finally getting my own and it's this great piece. It works great.,5
My son loves this Xbox x series he has been playing on it since he got it and that was 3 days ago.,5
"Spot this for my song so far, so good works well.Didn't seem like anything was wrong with it.And he plays it almost every day.",5
This xbox is like a brand new xbox I've had no issues at all for it to have been renewed or refinished or whatever. I am very pleasantly surprised. Iwanted to give a review once I've used it for more than 30 days.,5
"This Xbox Series X Console was a renewed edition, you can't even tell the difference. It looks brand new just like a new console and everything works great. It has 1TB storage and the games all downloaded pretty quick. My son was very happy and excited to receive this this Xbox series X console, it was a surprise for him and an early Christmas Gift from Me. It was shipped in 2 business days and arrived at my doorstep 2 days after it was ordered. Now that is what you call fast shipping. It was a good investment for my son and he loved it! Thank you To The Seller!",5
"It's working great, loving it. Just hate that I bought a Sealan monitor that had false advertising to go with it. It's 1080p and my Xbox is 8k. They lied.",5
My kids loved this. Good value and exceptional condition. Saved me some money for sure. Works perfectly,5
After working out some minor issues not related to the product itself I was able to get this to work no problem. Thank you!,5
I ordered this Xbox 360 to replace the one I currently had. Product arrived as described and works great. It came with all the necessary power and cords as well as a controller. The company took great care in packaging it for delivery as all parts were wrapped in bubble wrap.,5
"My son has the new One Box, and he also had this one when it first came out. He wanted another 360 XBOX for his birthday. I found this one; working perfectly and in excellent condition. Thank you for making my son’s birthday special!",5
The old product works perfectly.I love it and I'm happy with it.Thank you.I'm very satisfied.I hopeful to do more business with you.Once again thank you and very happy,5
Left for dead and left for dead 2.It's an old game I used to play with my best friend and the only reason I needed this oldie.Works well.,5

"Admittedly, I bought this just for Starfield, but I have been playing Fallout 4 (thanks Oppenheimer!), and I can't stop thinking about it. The Xbox Series S is one of the most underrated consoles because, by a landslide, it has the most bang-for-your-buck. I have been playing my Nintendo Switch for the last 3 years, but once I started using this, I have been obsessed!Although the library is not as impressive as that of the Switch or PS5, it has actually been good for me because I am spending more time actually PLAYING games rather than contemplating which games to play on my backlog.I do understand that this is not for everyone. I suppose that if you have already been ""spoiled"" with top-line graphics, this would feel like a downgrade. However, because I bought this for Bethesda games, I could not be happier.Although it might not have the largest library and only slightly inferior graphics than a PS5 (although I don't notice), this console makes up for those shortcomings with it's lean performance. Although it does ""less,"" everything it does is exceptional and meaningful.The only bad thing is that some games did not run properly when I first booted up the console, but after I power-cycled (turn it off for 10 seconds, unplug for 10 seconds, then start it again), everything runs silky smooth.",5
"OMG I was so nervous to buy the refurbished one but, it works so perfectly.",5
Was skeptical since it was refurbished but all came in original packaging and works well!,5
"I always wanted one for Christmas mommy, thank you so much for buying this present.",5
"Bought the gaming system for my nephew. Which I know nothing about lol. All I know is that he wanted an Xbox. Went to the store to purchase a game of his choice to find out this system is digital meaning you can only purchase games online and not the actual disk. Well after a few days of thinking about it, I thought that was the best thing ever! No more lost or scratched games. So now we just go online and purchase all his games and dont have to worry about anything getting scratched or lost. Also, we have access to the gaming store which allows his access to over 100s of kids games that he really enjoys playing. Win win for this aunt!",5
Loved this product so much but my husband loved it more for his birthday !,5
It works perfectly no problems,5
"Fast loading times, good graphics, not much left to be desired. Overall a good budget xbox.",5
"Never ordered a refurbished console before, it came like new , controller and cords seems brand new , the console was made june 2024Everything was like newVery impressed",5
"It came out of the box wrapped like a candy, great package and fast delivery.",5
I honestly love it it looks great simple but great fits the vibe I'm going for in my set up love the different light options and overall it's pretty good quality,5
"My headset sits nicely atop, and all the extra USB is nice! I didn't think I'd like the mouse cord thing BUT I FRICKIN LOVE IT. It's something I never thought I'd need?? It's super dope haha. I love the colors too. I have a green theme goin with my gaming setup and it is an excellent addition. It's sturdy but not too heavy, and was super easy to set up. Would totally buy or gift again.",5
Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas last year. Still in great condition. Lights up and looks sleek. Love the mouse bungee.Really elevates his gaming area.,5
I would recommend this product. So cute,5
"this is expensive....i paid $40....but is it really?you get: 3 usb's one to power the unit, and 2 extras....the usbs have never failed, the included power cord is 100% the nicest cord i have ever received from any product...i buy lots of pc, music, gaming equipment...the cord is also long.the 7 colors you can cycle are acceptable. I found no trouble matching the red - green - blue colors to both my corsair and razor accessories.the base of the unit has nice flair out with really good non slip rubber bottoms this thing will not move unless u want it to.this is the only bungee i have used, i cannot say its better or worse than any other product, but, it also does exactly what i expect it to do, i set the amount of line i want out and if its not enough or too much, i can make that adjustment and once it is set, unless you physically remove the line from its channel, it also will remain as set.I own several headsets: fits hd600s, dt770, astro a40/50s, hyper cloud headsets....i cant see a headset not fitting on this thing, also, i cant find a single thing i do not like about it.the only negative i could find was price....the usb hub has not failed, not one port, i have owned for 1 year....if someone sells an offbrand that offers the same, the difference could be those port quality and the usb included in the box, to me its worth the price for quality.",5
Holds my headphones nicely,5
"Can trust how sturdy it stands,usb ports for extra wires and ambient light colors pop great.",5
Looks cool. The lights work well.Great little stand. Would buy again.,5
"Holds my headset really well, and love how I can pic the colour or leave it on colour change mode. Great product.",5
"Works perfect as a quick replacement for my kids system. They love it. Fast shipping, no problems.",5
"Microsoft XBOX ONE is by far my fav system I ever purchased. I have been enjoying console gaming for like decades, since Atari 2600, Intellevision, ColecoVision, all the way through NES, SNES, N64, GameCube, Sony PlayStation, PS2, PS3, ect. There is something about the style and power of XBOX ONE that really stands out. The Series X has faster load times, but I like having the optical disc drive. 5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
"I had my 360 S (250 GB) for a few years, it was my media streamer, it was pretty much an integral part of my home theater system. I had just returned the one I purchased at Amazon, pangs of guilt really, there is a GameStop near my house (6 miles, near some great burrito restaurants ). This morning my 360S ate a disk, well, that was it's end. With all the points I had at Gamestop and all the points I would get from the purchase (PS4 or Xbox) new console would make it worth it. Of course there was a great burrito on my mind for the post purchase feast. It never happened, I ran home to set this machine up.The Xbox One set up really quickly, the update which runs at the of the first startup really went fast, I guess there wasn't a lot of internet traffic, it ran in 10 minutes, I signed in with my Xbox Gold ID and lo and behold, everything came back, except of course new games and stuff (music and videos) I stream in from my Mac through NullRiver 360Connect. I noticed my HTR was telling me that I was receiving a DTS encoded signal from my new Xbox One, sweet. I thought the improved spatial sound quality and clarity was in my head, it was, it came through my ears.So now, in spite of a currently limited application base, they have my two favorites, Amazon Instant Video and Netflix. Everything looks and sounds beautiful. I purchased a new copy of ""Watch Dogs"" with some of my bonus points and the game play was really great, I think I'm really loving the Xbox one, as I type this review I'm typing away I'm watching a show done in 1080p with some really nice sound, all in all, this box is totally worth it as a streamer if nothing else. Sure I played Watch Dogs for a few minutes and then went back and listened to some Xbox music, all done in Dolby Digital, which my Mac Mini won't do, but any modern PC will, but that is a subject for another day..What a treat, I got to hear some real sonic imagining and separation, not the usual cacophonous mush that comes out of my Mac Mini. The Xbox one looked around my network and at my history with Xbox music and in a few minutes my entire music library was up and ready to go. Look, I'm like a kid with a new toy, I will probably be up in an all night media fest, if for no other reason than I'm enjoying the sonic imagery and great picture quality.The games will come in time, but right now, an Xbox is once again the primary quality streaming device in my system, now I can have over 100 TB of additional storage and I already have 6TB on the Mac's desktop. All in all with trade in and bonus points the whole thing was a deal. This is one really nice piece of hardware, serving both as a console and multimedia center. It's even pretty and is size wise it's about a 2U rack mount, small and sleek enough to look good in your home theater center. The 360 S had a great sound chip, the One is has an even better sound processor as well as a much better graphics processor.Microsoft was right in some of their ideas about integration into Home Theater, it is a good thing, because so few pay attention to these details, which make the Xbox One a great piece of equipment for any home entertainment system. The Xbox Gold network is about as secure and reliable as networks get. Most server rooms are populated with MS Server Products as I'm sure the Microsoft network is. This is an advantage Microsoft holds quietly over other console vendors.When my Xbox 360 S died this morning all I could think about was the pain of replacing it, once I took it the Xbox One out of the box, the Xbox one took very little time to set up and started producing high quality material with a low signal to noise ratio and great gain to the preamp. My mourning for my old Xbox 360 S was over at that point.It's value as a piece of home entertainment is far greater than it's price.",5
"Works just like a new model, cant tell the difference. Very good",5
It arrived in good condition and works really good. It was the perfect gift.,5
"The packaging was great. the controller had everything working and was clean. The cables work great (might want to get a converter to HDMI as well). The only thing ""wrong"" was big scratches on the top and some minorly loose ports, but that kinda stuff is expected from a 20-year-old Xbox. Games run well and work fine. Don't be expecting great-resolution gaming though. This is 20 years old after all. Check out PC emulators if you prefer high resolution.",5
"Thank you so much for a perfectly working original XBOX folks. I'm an original developer for Pac Man World 2, flagship game for XBOX and wanted to introduce the game to my grandkids. You help make their retro game room, and my Pac Man revisit, a wonderful reality. Thanks again. -- Cyndi Monter",5
"I bought this in response to a request for an ""old"" X-Box. Sure, I have one of these... but I love it, and still use it on occasion. So I ordered another one to give as a gift.Imagine my delight when I presented this to the person who asked for it, and was told (and I quote): ""Not that one. The X-360.""Needless to say, I returned it, and the little ingrate can buy his own console with the $50 gift card he got (and that's only because my wife insisted that I couldn't get him nothing). I still love the original X-Box and recommend it highly. Mine has held up for 17 years, and still keeps plugging along.Lesson learned... and I saved myself a chunk of change. (about $160, by my reckoning). Enjoy the gift card, punk.",5
"My son really wanted this. I was not sure it was going to be good considering it was renewed, but I was pleased with how well it looked and worked.",5
"It's easy to use, charges quickly, and had a great price.",5
"Great phone, everything as described, and unlocked. Thanks",5
"Was skeptical to buy at first because it may not work with a different carrier (Globe and Smart in PH) but when it arrived, I immediately tested it if it works and guess what, it did work 100%. Best decision ever. Will update the performance of this phone after a month.Update: For dual sim users, the only minor inconvenience on this phone is there is no preferred sim selection feature on sim settings where i need to switch to my second sim to primary just for the data but overall, the system is not bad at all given that exynos has issue when it comes to temperature and I haven't experienced like a hot uncomfortable feeling (It might differ when you live in a tropical country).",5
This is my 3rd time buying a phone on Amazon from Samsung and they all worked great. I love this one so much because of the color! Phone was factory unlocked so I was able to put my cricket SIM card in with no problems!,5
Love the larger screen size. Came unlocked and super easy to setup. Battery life is 2+ days with average use.,5
"Takes excellent pictures that I can edit and remove background easily which is what I needed. With 7 years of updates I don't have to worry about being obsolete anytime soon, the screen and response time is excellent. Charges fast even though it's the 25 watt charger. I opted for the 256 gb memory which is the most you can get on this model. The only con is it is fairly heavy. Iam happy with what I got without spending 100s to get slight upgrades",5
"After reading about this phone in articles and reviews, I expected problems. But the phone surprised me. It's doing very well!This A15 feels heavier and more sturdy than my old A51. The screen is brighter and more readable. It charges quicker and the battery lasts longer.I don't do anything intensive on my phone. I make calls, send texts, browse to look something up, use maps, etc.--no complex games or anything. I also took off all the game bloatware it came with to free up space. The phone handles all I do very well. I do notice a slight lag between pressing a button and getting a response. I can live with that. For the price, this is an outstanding phone that meets my needs.",5
"I purchased this phone as a backup in case one of our phones breaks. After the initial setup, it was soooo slow I almost boxed it back up to return. But I remembered encountering this issue on other phones, caused by restoring data and apps from previous phone.I decided to fully update the phones software, factory reset it, and then declined to skip the prompt to transfer data from other device. Immediate difference. NIGHT AND DAY. make sure you try this if it's slow out of the box. I honestly think I might switch over to budget phones long term, this is great for the price, and handles everything just fine. Full days usage and I'm ending the day with 58% battery.",5
"I liked that it was Samsung and not fully loaded with features I did not want. For everyday use and photos it's great, fast and has a large enough screen. I am not a tecchi so It took me awhile to go through all the settings, etc., but the most cool thing is that there can be two sim cards and you can have two phone numbers. Oh yes and be sure you get the right version. There is the Latin American version, the International version and of course, the USA version.I bought the unlocked USA version, since I already had ATT. I Have been to the ATT store to get some help with some settings and they were wonderful, since this phone is no longer directly, available from ATT ,the sales people were really OK with my purchase sold by Amazon. They did tell me that buying the phone from Amazon, was a good thing, rather than buying it from third parties, because of service and warranty issues.",5
"Obviously the price was great, does not feel like a low budget phone. Pretty speedy, and response full.OS got the upgrade 1 month in. The camera is decent, the audio speakers sound very good. I can't complain about the display either.Great value/performance.Ok there is one thing, but honestly, I can live with our itUnlock other moto phones, this is missing the twist feature that opens up the camera.And that's it, that my only gripe...ha ha a software feature because the gyroscope hardware is not present. Also does not have two features that have never used, but at the price I bought this for, would not expect. NFC and wireless charging.",5
"Battery lasts longer then I thought almost but not quite 3 days being carried every day wish it had a lil more space I got it for my kiddo that started middle school this year he's been carrying it pretty much every day dose lag a bit but I think it's mainly cuz he's out of space lol still works tho still lagged when I first got it a lil but not like it dose with no space , I charged it and kept it up for the first week till I got his sim card Battery barely moves if it's not being used id dare say it might last close to a month just sitting idle would be a good phone for an older guy or gal that don't play on there phones like the younger generations itd last quite a while without needing charged looks like the photos and theres a few cases on here to choose from to put on it too",5
"My Pixel 8 Pro broke, so I purchased this as a temporary replacement while I fix my pixel. It's really a nice phone, the camera sucks, but otherwise it works well!",5
"Honestly I love this phone. I love that the screen isn't glass. It's an amazingly easy setup, unlike Asus or Samsung phones. A large pint of the typical Google Bloatware that you can't uninstall, which is just so dumb. Nobody wants these default Google TV and Google Meet apps. They're garbage and take up battery, memory, and they probably get a ton of your personal data with these things just running in the background. Just terrible. But the phone is amazing. I love that the phone feels way smaller with it folded. It takes up less space on a desk and in your pocket. The front screen is great. Didn't ever care for things like that in the past, but it's awesome having it. The fingerprint sensor is lightning quick, but I'm not a fan of it being on the power button. Better than being on the screen but you have to like do a mental calculation of which finger to press the power button with. But the build quality and construction is top notch. I'm probably going to get another after this one kicks the bucket. The folding gimmick alone is so cool and a nice conversation piece.9.5/10. It would be 10/10 if not for the completely stupid bloatware, that nobody wants or asked for.",5
"I got this to replace an old Nokia phone.I wanted to get something that was small and portable. (Carrying a tablet sized phone is cumbersome.) After doing a little research I found the razr, a phone that folds up and stores easily when not in use.This razr (not the plus version) has a nice, solid feel, has more features than I'll ever need, and is simply a joy to use.I don't use this for games or photos/video... I use it for calls, texts, a few stock apps, and listening to music (it has 128 gigs of internal data, which is fine for me.) I use Ultra mobile, the phone recognized my SIM card without issue.When closed the mini screen has basic functionality, but that's not a con for me, it isn't distracting. The texture of the 'vegan leather' shell gives it a premium feel and look that's appreciated.After tinkering with the UI this would probably make a good minimalist style phone. I like it. 👍",5
"My wife loves her phone she got it in the mail today. Amazon handled it with care. I was initially worried we wouldn't be able to use it with cricket but, when it arrived we took it to the cricket store had the phone number transferred to her new phone. Everything is already backed up on the phone. It is functional, it is easily connectable, it was unlocked, the screen quality is really good, memory capacity is great, and I was able to finance it with affirm which is $27 a month which is affordable to me and a great value for my wife to have a great phone that she loves and is excited about. Great job Amazon and great job Motorola the RAZR 2023 is so good my parents who hate high tech stuff are actually looking into getting themselves each one after seeing hers!",5
"I was apprehensive about getting a refurb of such an old console, but I specifically needed nothing more exotic than a 360. The set from Retrorefresh arrived quickly and well-packaged, and was complete. Most of the pieces could have passed for new or almost new. Unfortunately, the console itself had a ding in the corner, probably suffered during packing or shipping. The unit would not boot up. I emailed Dan at Retrorefresh, as instructed on the card that came with the unit. He immediately offered to send me another unit. The new set arrived about four days later, and was just as nice as the first. It booted up easily, and after updating the firmware, I was able to use the unit just fine. I boxed up the defective unit using the original packaging materials and sent it back to them immediately. Two things impressed me about Retrofresh: The components had been well cleaned and packaged (unlike some of the horror stories that one hears about refurb products); and Dan's quick, no-questions-asked response when I reported a problem. I would gladly deal with these guys again.",5
Worked good my son still has it til this day,5
Product was clean and functioning very well. Very good purchase!,5
"The only complaint is the small size of each container of slime. That aside, my daughter had lots of fun and still has three of the containers and plays with the slime regularly.It is not sticky, holds together well, and comes with lots and lots of things to mix into it.",5
"Great value for the money and it came with two great games that my daughter loves. They arrived quickly, and was easy to set up.",5
"I’ll tell ya what, this Xbox was supposed to come with a headset but it didn’t and you know what I don’t even care because the condition of this console is crazy it all looks fantastic and I’m very impressed I’ll definitely be buying multiple units they took care of bagging each individual item in bubble wrap heavy too I’m very happy with this purchase love my Xbox 360 like I did in 2010. Thank you retro refresh you guys are the bomb 🔥🔥",5
I like everything about it works really well,5
"Its everything it sad, I am very happy with it. Just don't know how to get the free 1 month gold pass lol. I am very happy I got this deal.",5
My 7th old is obsessed with Paris for some reason. This little lamp is perfect for his night stand! Comes in 3 different colors &he likes the blue the best! My only negative is its actually a little too bright for my older eyes but he seems to love it &that's all that mattered!,5
"My 4 yr old daughter kept telling me she wanted a jellyfish, so I saw this and got it for her as a nightlight. She loves it!!",5
it actually is nice. When you turn it off there is tan paper on the back. it changes colors to red and pink,5
My daughter loves jellyfish and was incredibly pleased!,5
Was a hit at the office! Love it!,5
Could be a bit thicker,5
"this is actually my son's second one of these. His first one lasted longer than I thought it would. He got the first one when he was 7, now he's 9 and still loves tossing it in the air to let it fall and smash on the ground.Tons of fun, just keep it away from smaller kids. His first one died when little brother bit a hole in it.",5
"My 8 yr old really liked this. We orderrd a small one and were out of town for the weekend when it was delivered and came back on Sunday. He only got to play with it yesterday and part of today, Monday, and we noticed today there is a thinned area/hole under the ear and it is leaking sand. :( this stretchy toy doesn't bounce back to its original shape due to it being filled with sand, so the unique thing about this is that if you drop it for example, it keeps it's flattened shape until you move the sand around and reshape it. Hoping we can exchange it for a new one.Updated from 2 to 5 stars: We returned the first item, got a replacement and haven't had any problems with it, thank you. My son enjoys playing with it. :)",5
"The quality is very good, and my son really likes it",5
my 12 year old grandson loves it,5
"I recently tried Meto Purple Toothpaste for Teeth Whitening, and I couldn't be happier with the results. This toothpaste has truly transformed my smile, and I can't stop showing it off!From the moment I opened the sleek packaging, I was impressed. The tube design is not only eye-catching but also convenient to use. The deep purple color of the toothpaste itself is intriguing and adds a touch of elegance to my daily dental routine.The texture is smooth and gentle on my teeth and gums, making it easy to brush for the recommended two minutes without any discomfort. The minty flavor is refreshing, leaving my mouth feeling clean and my breath smelling great.What sets Meto Purple Toothpaste apart is its whitening power. After just a few weeks of regular use, I noticed a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. Coffee and wine stains that had plagued me for years started to fade away. My friends and family even commented on how much brighter my smile looked.What's even better is that this toothpaste doesn't cause any sensitivity, which I've experienced with other whitening products. I can confidently use it daily without worrying about discomfort or enamel damage.Meto Purple Toothpaste is now a staple in my oral care routine, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone looking for an effective and enjoyable teeth-whitening solution. If you want a radiant smile without the hassle and sensitivity, give this toothpaste a try. It's a game-changer!",5
"I normally do not do reviews except for product that really impresses me.I saw this on Instagram and found it intriguing, I have blond highlights and have been using purple shampoo for years. So, I thought lets see if does the same thing.Im here to tell you it DOES- you see results the very first time you use it, it is truly amazing. I bought it for my daughters and my sister.I gave the rating of 4 stars for the flavor- it really doesn't have any taste at all.I use my regular toothpaste first then the purple toothpaste for the clean teeth-fresh breath feelingI highly recommend you give it a try- you wont be sorry.",5
"I was cautious when purchasing this purchasing because my hygienist told me that my natural tooth color is not white like other people and a whitening agent might cause streaking. I chose to give this one a try anyway, and it whitened my teeth to the exact level I was looking for.Not neon white, but not coffee yellow.I have tried bleaching trays w/ blue light, whitening toothpaste couple with whitening mouth wash, and nothing got me to the level of white I was striving for.2 uses if this fabulous product and I am SO HAPPY!Now I just do a maintenance brush once to twice a week to counter act my coffee consumption.",5

"I recently tried the teeth whitening foam, and I must say, I'm impressed with the results! The product is incredibly easy to use - just a quick pump onto my toothbrush, and I was ready to go. After using it for a couple of weeks, I noticed a visible improvement in the color of my teeth. They looked noticeably whiter and brighter. What I appreciated most was that there was no sensitivity or discomfort, which I've experienced with other teeth whitening products. The foam has a pleasant taste, making it a breeze to incorporate into my daily oral care routine. Overall, I highly recommend this teeth whitening foam for its effectiveness, ease of use, and gentle formula. It's a game-changer for anyone looking to achieve a brighter smile!",5
"I tried this purple teeth whitening for a few days and saw the results of brighter teeth and the yellow shade was gone. I can't believe it. The teeth look so vibrant and white. I will try to give the most honest review. Apply 4 pumps in the mouth and swish for 30 seconds. I also used a toothbrush to make my teeth whiter at the same time. It is easy to use and has excellent whitening power. The smile really stood out and I got more compliments. The purple colorant in the foam offsets the yellowing of teeth caused by coffee consumption. I have tried several to help whiten my teeth and I have had the best results using this product. I recommend this purple toothpaste for your use. This purple teeth whitening is amazing and I plan to use it every day, will be ordering more!",5
"There is no weird feeling or taste while using it and it works fast! I am a heavy coffee drinker and have stained teeth. So I needed a product like this. I can't wait to see what continued use will look like! As promised, it seems to remove the yellowish stains on my teeth. Each brush seems to have an effect. I was pleasantly surprised! I will continue to monitor the staining for improvement. I will have a bright smile. Whitens my teeth and is easy to use. good taste. I was very happy and did not disappoint! Love purple teeth whitening to whiten my teeth. Would recommend purple toothpaste to anyone. good product.",5
"I was somewhat put off with the purple color but found very quickly that it rinsed wonderfully. The Taste was neutral and I was so happy with the outcome! I received a lot for my money, the size was bigger than I thought it would be. My teeth are so much brighter and it just seems to be a great value for what little money I paid! A great product with great quality!",5
"I wasn't sure I'd like this toothpaste because I'm really picky with flavors. This has a very mild mint that I actually enjoy. The purple wasn't super vibrant, so I worried it wouldn't whiten. It does though and I can see shades difference in my teeth despite my daily sweet tea.",5
"I drink about 2 cups of coffee per day and unfortunately, my teeth are stained and I always have to use a teeth whitening toothpaste, so I am very familiar with them. My teeth were a bit yellow looking, as I brushed them using this toothpaste, they gradually whitened over about 5 minutes time. I am very surprised and happy with the results. I thought it would take several days of brushing, both morning and evening, but it only took one time - and with no gum irritation. I highly recommend it, too.",5
I changed the color on the first use!!,5
"I never right reviews. I’ve used this product 2 times a day and have just finished day 2. I can really see a difference, at least 2 shades lighter. I have very sensitive teeth so have been unable to use traditional teeth whiteners, I have no sensitivity with this product. I am over the moon with this product!",5
Cute for a stocking stuffer. My 4 year old loves it,5
Works great! Use daily for whitening results.,5
"I thought the toothpaste would be a dark purple as you were brushing and make a mess, but it really wasn’t. It was a really light pink so that was good. It also didn’t have any bad taste so far so good.",5
So far I am very pleased with the product. It was a shipped and received the next day. Doesn’t leave residue or bad aftertaste. 3 days in I already see results. I am definitely happy with my purchase.,5
Its better than regular toothpaste where it burns or has a bad after taste that messes with the taste of whatever you have to eat in a few hours. This toothpaste doesn't have any of that and is practically just liquid so you dont even feel it in your mouth while you're brushing.,5
I used this product to get rid of my yellow stained teeth and have white teeth.,5
This is what I’ve been looking for! I like that there’s two options to use but my favorite is the brush for one minute. I do this after brushing with regular toothpaste and feel extra clean and my teeth look brighter and more white.,5
"This whitening foam works well as a foam rinse and the mint flavor it not overpowering. Can't even taste it after a min.You pump 4 times directly into your mouth, swish it around, spit and rinse. The dye does enhance your teeth to be whiter if your going for a dress to impress type of thing.You can also brush it directly on your teeth.",5
The foaming purple toothpaste brings a refreshing twist to a basic routine. The toothpaste provides a satisfying clean and the unique formula leaves my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth really white.I would recommend this product if you’re looking to whiten your teeth for an affordable price.,5
"The product is easy to use and my teeth feels squeaky clean after which is a bonus. The taste is also pleasant, which makes for a smoother experience. I do also feel the effectiveness of the purple against my non - white teeth and I’m excited to see how it can further improve my teeth color.",5
"Not flavored but the taste is fine, love that it has such clean ingredients and definitely makes my teeth feel clean. Would recommend!",5
"This toothpaste has really helped my sensitivity in so many ways from cold, hot items, sweet items you name it. This is the only toothpaste that reduces my sensitivity. With flavored toothpaste, I’ve noticed that I wake up with morning breath, but with this toothpaste, I don’t. I also use it on my son and he hasn’t had any cavities since using this toothpaste as well as myself!! I will keep buying.",5
"So while this toothpaste IS flavorless, it is a little bit sweet. This might not meet everyone's needs, but it worked out really great for me.I really like the Hi Smile toothpastes (you know, the ones that come in all different kinds of flavors). They are great! But... they only contain fluoride and I really wanted something with Hydroxyapatite. I looked around the internet and this was the best option I could find in flavorless. I use a pump of the Hi Smile in any flavor, and a small dollop of this toothpaste. I can't tell any difference in the flavor, or texture. I really like it.",5
"No taste, it's so wonderful, texture is great, helps my sensitivity, it's expensive but good value because i love knowing they test each batch for safety, ingredients are perfect and it's been whitening my teeth.",5
I really like the flavor how it was put in I like the strawberry taste and I hope you can make more just like that The money or the value of the money was way too much,5
"I am an adult that has never liked mint... I have tried SO many tooth pastes, and all either are chalky and gross, or I find out they actually contain mint. I have a very sensitive tongue, so I can taste a bit of mint in this, but its the best none-mint tooth paste I have ever found.",5
This is the ONLY toothpaste that my 10yr old daughter likes. Of course they stopped selling it in Walmart then all stores stopped selling it. You can only get the watermelon flavored one in Walmart and other stores. Thank the heavens that Amazon sells it!! It is more expensive on Amazon but nowhere else sells it. I keep a full unopened bottle under the sink just in case Amazon stops selling it. The Watermelon flavor is cheaper then Strawberry. Idk why.,5
"I am an adult who hates mint flavored anything - especially tooth paste so this was a great find on Amazon. It is just a bit more expensive then tube type tooth paste and you have to be a bit careful putting it on your brush as it can squirt out and is a semi liquid gel, but these are minor problems.",5
"I'm a college student so technically not the audience intended, but the taste of mint makes me incredibly nauseous. This makes brushing teeth an actually acceptable experience!",5
"Teeth brushing always ended up in tears....my 3 year old hated the mint toothpaste and after spending hours looking in different shops trying to find an alternative flavour (which there are none) I resorted to buying online.,which i was a little sceptical about because sometimes you just don’t know what your getting. But alas this is brilliant....no more tears,loves the taste An tooth brushing is a whole new experience for him.Will definitely be buying more.",5
Really nice. I wanted to have a difference from mint toothpaste. Nice taste and leaves teeth feeling clean. Good that it is fluoride and also sugar free. I now alternate between this and a mint one. Highly recommended.,5
Purchased as bedtime toothbrushing has become a traumatic game of hide and seek and always ends in tears! My 2 year old was complaining that toothbrushing hurt and after trying several different soft brushes (& even tried my finger) I realised it might be the minty toothpastes. Have only used this a couple times but had a lot less tears; he still doesn't like brushing his teeth but isn't complaining of soreness. Will continue with this for now so at least teeth are getting brushed but will aim to return to normal toothpaste in the future as I'm not convinced flavoured pastes clean as well.,5
"My daughter has been asking me for the purple tik tok toothpaste for a month and I finally gave in. I was completely shocked it actually made her teeth so much whiter! She’s been using it for about a week (doesn’t use it every day) and even just after the first use there was a huge difference! I will be buying more when it runs out - it’s a good size bottle for the price and unlike regular toothpaste you do t use it every time do it should last awhile! Great product, highly recommend!",5
"I got this for my teenage son who saw it on social media. We've had it for about a week and so far he said the test is ""ok"". The concept with the purple is good and unique and makes him want to brush his teeth more which is always a win. Jury is still out on how effective it will be at whitening. As for the price, it is a little high but if it follows through on the whitening, again it will be well worth it. Thanks.",5
I think this product works well and whitens my teeth. The only problem is that you need to leave it on at least 2 minutes and it becomes a very thin layer on your teeth when u do that so I ass more as I’m doing the process daily. It’s lasted a long time and I’ll definitely try it again..,5
"This toothpaste has been trending lately so I decided to give it a try. I immediately noticed a difference in the appearance of my teeth. This toothpaste is of high quality. It has a neutral taste, unlike some of the spicy toothpastes. It comes in a very nice, elegant bottle which you can take anywhere due to its small size. You only need a few dabs of it on your toothbrush, and you’re good to go!",5
"Evexia Science Tooth Powder left my mouth feeling incredibly clean, like that ""just left the dentist"" sensation. It did a fantastic job removing plaque, which is exactly what I was looking for in a toothpaste alternative.However, there are a few things to consider. The flavor is quite strong, and it definitely takes some getting used to using a powder compared to traditional toothpaste or gel. The switch in texture might surprise some people at first.Despite these initial adjustments, I've been very impressed with Evexia Science Tooth Powder's effectiveness. If you're looking for a powerful plaque remover and don't mind a strong flavor or using a powder, then this product is definitely worth a try!",5
"A family member recommended I try the Honest Tooth Cleaning Powder. I've used it for a while now and am glad to see it's offered through Amazon. I love the mild flavor -- not overpowering with mint. Most toothpastes I've tried leave a film on my teeth, but this tooth powder leaves my teeth clean. I like that the pH balance neutralizes to reduce bacteria in the mouth. That has to be a good thing. Best of all, it reduced the plaque on my teeth sufficiently for my dental hygienist to mention it at my last two appointments. One thing I do when using this product, is to scoop out a small amount of the dry powder into a small bowl. I then dip my wet brush into that, instead of risking getting my main supply wet and clumpy from a wet toothbrush. It seems to work better for me that way.",5
"This has changed the way I brush my teeth and how I feel about brushing. It used to be a disliked chore. Now, I crave brushing because of the way it makes my teeth and mouth feel. It feels like I have gently massaged my teeth after brushing. I also enjoy the fresh and natural taste. I love knowing that I am brushing with real ingredients, not a bunch of chemicals. This is a real game-changer.",5
I wasn't sure this would work. I tried it and it really worked! My teeth and mouth feel so much cleaner and fresher. I have plaque and stains on my teeth from drinking coffee and my teeth look brighter. After the first use my plaque os going away!! Happy purchaser!,5
This toothpaste has a great flavor and leaves your mouth feeling fresh. Also saw a whitening difference after 2 brushing.,5
I brush my teeth twice consecutively using 1 tablet each time. It gave me a better clean that way. Avoid swallowing even though it might remind you of mint candy. Haha! I wished it foamed up more yet it goes the job.,5
I love the convenience and being able to get rid of messy toothpaste tubes. Leave mouth clean and fresh.,5
It is a great way to clean teeth and save the earth at the same time!,5
"Great product, easy to assemble, easy to use, reaches in hard to reach places. I used it for cleaning my ceiling, fans, behind TV stands and even shelf tops. Great battery life and easy to clean and store.Recommend this product strongly to anyone looking for a duster, brush, or even soapy wash around the house. All extensions are thoughtfully put together in one easy purchase.",5
"The 2 speed TORNADO ELECTRIC SPIN SCRUBBER is a lifesaving tool to help ease the workload of the average homeowner. If you are like me, the cleaning of the tub and shower seems to be the hardest chore in the house. My shower is tile, and it gets dirty fast. but then again so do I. Having to ability to spin scrub the Tile and the Grout saves me so much time I can watch the latest football game on Prime and actually have a decent meal. I can honestly say that using the Tornado scrub cleaner has saved my back and knees, which is so important when it comes to home chores.I give the TORNADO SPIN SCRUBBER a 5 out of 5 rating for saving my back and knees, efficient cleaning and long lasting charge.joe",5
"I like its quality and many attachments, I am happy with this purchase",5
"I have a confession, and that confession is I've become helplessly in love with ear irrigation. I know it's not the healthiest thing, but I WAS told it's better than all other versions of ear cleaning and so I'm sticking with it. I am not a doctor.That said, I CAN tell you my ears are disgusting. When I was a kid they were constantly compacted, and now they are just constantly itchy, and regularly mild scratching around the edges of the hole causes clumps to fall out, and they STILL get compacted. I have so much ear wax being produced at all times.And again, let me reiterate: ITCHY. SO. FLIPPIN'. ITCHY. And there was for the longest time nothing I could do about it! I did hydrogen peroxide cleans and ...that doesn't really help the itching, it more just...makes me dizzy and sort of cleans my ears. Various mineral oils didn't help the itchiness either. Nothing did.Until...this. I got this. I used it. First, just SO MUCH NONSENSE came out. Gross stuff ahead but ten massive clods came out, and afterward, my hearing was much better - I cranked down all my volumes a good 10 levels because suddenly I could hear again. But the FEELING. THE FEELING OF HAVING SOMETHING SCRATCH ITCHES I'D LONG SUFFERED...it was true euphoria. It was heavenly. I transcended to another plane. I needed a cigarette once I was done.And now, a few days later, my ears still don't itch again. They just feel good. And I can still hear. And already another massive clod HAS fallen out of my ear but -- I am so excited to have this on hand for when things start itching again.More boring level: It's very sturdy and easy to use.",5
"First, a caution. This is not a toy and while kids no doubt would like to play with the ""fountain"", it should be kept out of reach and never be used without adult supervision and control. For anyone, this could cause severe ear damage if used incorrectly. Also, start on the low setting and do not jam into your ear, just gently insert the tip.Warnings aside, this is a well built device. Some quirks, like the power connector is inside, above the water reservoir. Another is that the water reservoir doesn't screw on, but it looks like it should. It uses a rubber gasket to maintain a seal, but it feels a little loose. The other item of note is that while it uses a USBC charging connection, it only seemed to work with the cable it came with. My other USBC cables did not work.After testing on one ear I used a q-tip to gently go around the outermost area of the ear canal. It came out clean. On the left ear, not so clean, so it worked. I've used other devices and this one is much quieter and made for a better experience.Overall I'd recommend this, just be careful when using it! The medium and high settings make for significant water pressure.",5
"The media could not be loaded. Just got the electric ear wax remover for the family! Game changer! Safe, effective, and super easy for all ages. Say goodbye to old-school methods. Our ears have never felt clearer!",5
"I as skeptical at first. Saw a Facebook post for one of these with a lady trying it out in her car lol. She was mesmerized at what was coming from her ears. I keep mine clean as well, as best we can with Q tips. This doesn’t hurt or fell uncomfortable. It’s actually quit soothing.",5
Seams be be a good quality build.,5
This product has made cleaning such a joy. It is nice that it can stay on and helps reduce any scrubbing. We call it our magic cleaning toothbrush! Can't recommend enough.,5
Handiest cleaner! Battery life is decent. Very powerful. Bristles stay stiff even after being used tremendously. Variety of attachments is good. Size is excellent!,5
"larger heads then it look, but I love it.",5
I couldn't find anything that would clean my grout in the shower but this did.,5
Working well- on time delivery - nice product - can clean small equipment - shoes. Corner of wall tile - wash basin,5
"The app is an easy download, it works through wifi on your phone, and the camera is pretty decent quality. This is really super gross and VERY satisfying. I'm honestly glad I got this, but I don't produce as much earwax as I thought?? SO who knows how often it will get used, but it was still satisfying and entertaining. My ears never felt so clear haha",5
"I was a bit skeptical about using an ear wax removal tool with a camera, but this device exceeded my expectations in every way. Here's my experience with the Ear Wax Removal Tool Camera:Clarity & Camera Quality: The 1296P camera quality is excellent! I was able to clearly see inside my ear, which made the whole process much safer and more effective. The 6 LED lights provide great illumination, so I could easily spot and remove any wax. The image was sharp and detailed, much better than I anticipated for such a small device. It’s reassuring to see exactly what I’m doing while cleaning.Ease of Use: The setup was simple, and connecting the otoscope to my iPhone was quick and hassle-free. The app interface is intuitive, and the live feed from the camera was smooth with no lag. The tool itself is well-designed, with a comfortable grip that made it easy to maneuver inside the ear without any discomfort. It comes with different tips to suit your needs, and I found the whole process straightforward, even as a first-time user.Comfort & Safety: I really appreciate the silicone tips that come with the tool, as they are soft and gentle on the ear canal. The camera gave me peace of mind because I could see exactly where I was going, reducing the risk of pushing wax further into my ear or causing irritation. The device also feels sturdy and well-made, which adds to the overall confidence I had while using it.Versatility: The fact that this tool works with both iOS and Android is a big plus. I used it on both my phone and tablet, and the experience was seamless on both platforms. The tool isn't just limited to ear cleaning either—I've used it to inspect other small areas, and it works great.Overall: This ear wax removal tool with a camera is a game-changer! It’s easy to use, the camera quality is superb, and it makes ear cleaning much safer and more effective than traditional methods. I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a reliable and high-tech way to keep your ears clean. Well worth the purchase!",5
"Where do I begin?? I have always wanted to try one of these ear cleaning tools but have been afraid to. I've seen reviews on similar products about the tips breaking off and people having to go the emergency room to have it dug out. Well, I can tell you that you won't have to worry about that happening with this product! The whole metal tip piece is one solid part, from the pen and camera tip down to the scooper tip, it is all one piece. This product came with a lot of little extras; you get a vial full of extra scooper covers, some are different shapes! You also get a charging cable (type C), and a little pouch of metal tools. There are several scoop tools and a little whisky looking one, but I have no idea what they are for. The instructions that came with this device were clear enough, but there was no instructions given on what the extra metal tools are for or how to use them (see listing picture for the extra metal tools).I expected that this device would plug into my phone to use it, but it actually connects via WiFi (no, not bluetooth either). You hold the button on the device down until the light flashes, and then you open your phone's WiFi settings to connect to the device. Once connected, you press ""Start"" in the app that you have to download to use the pen.From there, it's all fun and games. I was afraid of going too deep into my ear, because the little spoon end sticks out a bit from where the camera is. I was SO surprised by how clean my ears were, but also by how hairy they were. Looking inside your ears is both amazing and horrific. Although I didn't find any golden ear wax treasures inside my ears, I was astounded by the amount of blackheads I had on my outer ear; How embarrassing! I pressed the spoon tip against my ear using the camera to find every little pore, and I was able to eradicate the problem pretty effortlessly and painlessly.If you have ever been on the fence to purchase an ear cleaning camera before, this is your sign to buy this one now!! You will NOT regret it!",5
"This steam cleaner works great！It deep cleans everything，including the microwave, grease, tile, windows, kitchen, etc. I've cleaned various things with it and really love the many attachments. Small but powerful, extra long power cord for added ease of use, worth to try!",5
I just moved in new apartment. And I needed steam cleaner. Easy to use and included lots of attachment. It has really long cord. Functionality and good quality. I tried few steam cleaners before. That one is best for cleaning.,5
"So far I have used this on my windows, baseboards, mirrors, and all in my car. Works absolutely amazing. Easy to use, all you do is put in water and wait then it’s ready to use. It’s really good to get out and stick gunk like drinks spilt and gum that’s very stuck. Also it’s amazing for disinfecting which is why I used it on my entire car. Theirs a lot of different attachments for multiple uses so I think this is an essential for any home/car owner",5
"I recently purchased this steam cleaner, small but powerful. The best point is that this steamer is chemical-free and no harm to children and pets, so I can safely use it for cleaning.It has a long cord and multiple attachments, you can use it everywhere, such as kitchen, bathroom, windows, floor, car and many hard-to-reach areas.It mades cleaning so much easier and more efficient, satisfied!",5
"I really like this steam cleaner and its various attachments make my life easier and more hygienic. It is super easy to use and very lightweight. You don't have to pour dirty water, just use it and it gets the job done nicely. The price is also very reasonable.",5
"I bought this about a year ago and then stashed it away next to my vacuum cleaner knowing that I would probably use it one day. I've always been able to get the lint out of my filter, but I was getting tired of seeing a little bit of trailing lint down toward the bottom where I couldn't reach. I used to use chopsticks and covered the end of them with duct tape and that would get some of the lint out but it was a real pain in the butt. Anyway, I know this is kind of long, but I also think it's kind of funny and that I thought somebody could use a good laugh. I have a kitty at home who, if I don't put her dry food somewhere out of sight that I haven't put in the Tupperware yet for freshness, she will get into the bag and rip it open. I'm sure some of you have experienced similar situations yourselves with your pets. Anyway, happenstance would have it that I put her dry food bag in my dryer one day just to keep it out of sight. While my daughter was visiting one day she threw all the freshly cleaned clothes into the dryer and started it up without checking the dryer drum. You guessed it! After about 20 minutes we were hearing rattling around like pebbles or something and she went and opened the dryer. And oh my God, what a surprise we had awaiting! There was dry kitty food everywhere and thankfully it wasn't mushy or anything because the heat from the dryer must have unglued the glue on the cat's food bag and just opened the top. And holy cow, those bags are tough because it wasn't ripped anywhere! But then of course I had a horrible mess all over inside my dryer. And yes, it freaked me out. We shook the clothes out one by one and then I was left with the task of getting all the dry kitty food out of the dryer. I was able to salvage just about all of it with some of it of course catching in the dryer filter. I remembered having this vacuum cleaner filter for sucking out dryer lint and dug it out and oh my God! It worked like a charm and got every little bit out of there and I was able to vacuum out all the dustiness and everything from the kitty dry food. And then of course I went all over it again with a damp cloth and I even sprayed it with a little bit of air freshener. Thankfully, I didn't use fabric softener when I washed the clothes or when I dried them, or of course it would have ruined the kitty food. I think it's kind of a funny story and I'm so thankful that my dryer is fine and working great. Thanks for making a wonderful product and I'm so very thankful to have!",5
It fits in most dryer vents and is easy to use. It reaches down to clear out any lint. You might want to vacuum afterwards because lint kind of gets loose,5
"The perfect and low priced way to clean your dryer vent thoroughly without a vacuum! It’s easy to use, with a long bent design for easy use and movement inside the vent. It reaches deep inside to clean out most if not 95% of the lint. Immediately after using, my dryer showed a huge improvement in efficiency and consistency when drying. The bristles are rough but no scratches occurred in use. It also fits well inside the vent and again, has a design that makes it easy to clean. Highly recommend.",5
It really works. I took it out and was using it immediately upon receiving it. It's great!,5
Simple tool and works great to reach deep and remove lint!,5
The amount of lint trapped inside the dryer was crazy. This brush gets in deep and pulls it right out. It's easy to clean and an absolute must have,5
Unbelievable how much lint and fluff was removed with this very effective product. It easily got into hard to reach areas and now my laundry dryer vent is clean as a whistle. Even the lint trap area had an enormous amount of laundry fluff at the bottom of the machine. Looking forward to using this behind the fridge next.,5
I love this. Before I used a scrubbing brush and got back aches from bending for long periods of time. But this is super strong and gets the job done. The battery lasts through my whole clean and the different attachments help to get all areas of the bathroom.,5
I love this product. It really gets around the faucets and sink area extra clean. I would buy this again.,5
Works well for tub cleaning,5
Bought this so I wouldn’t have to get on my knees to clean the bath tub. It works great! Liked it so much I bought one to give as a wedding present,5
"Power, scrubs and this is worth it. I read through all the comments and was not sure at first but it is so worth it",5
"I hate cleaning baseboards, this tool has really made maintaining my baseboards and moldings a breezeThe design is well thought out, featuring a flexible head that easily contours to the shape of my baseboards, allowing me to clean those hard-to-reach areas without straining my back. The included microfiber pads are highly effective at picking up dust and dirt, and I appreciate that they are washable and reusable, making this tool both eco-friendly and cost-effective.Using the Baseboard Buddy is not only efficient but also time-saving. It significantly reduces the effort and time I used to spend on cleaning baseboards with traditional methods. The tool glides smoothly along the surfaces, leaving them spotless and free from dust buildup. Additionally, the handle extends comfortably, giving me better control and reach. Overall, I highly recommend the Baseboard Buddy for anyone looking to simplify their cleaning routine. It has truly transformed how I approach baseboard maintenance and has become an essential part of my cleaning arsenal!",5
"The Baseboard Buddy exceeded my expectations. Yes it’s great for baseboards and tops of doors, but that’s just the start. I love that I don’t have to move heavy furniture to do a whole wall. Its great for going in between the balastrudes on my staircase, fits perfectly between the rails. It’s also great for cleaning the horizontal wooden bars in between chair and barstool legs. No more bending over! I use it to dust the base of my Peloton, treadmill, and lamps as well.Pro tip: I bought the Zep foaming wall spray suggested with it. Worked great for greasy kitchen and sticky bathroom baseboards.",5
"I received my baseboard cleaner last week and have now used it multiple times as I walk around my house with it in hand! It does a great job. I've been cleaning my actually dirty baseboards with a new scrubber, which does a wonderful job. But many are just dusty. I will use this for keeping them all free of dust and debris. After reading all the negative comments about the flimsey handle prior to purchasing, I didn't even put that handle on it. I went straight to my garage and picked out a perfect length paint roller handle, screwed it on perfectly, and went to work. So I would happily recommend this product to all of you who like to have clean baseboards.",5
It works great and I am very happy with this product!,5
"This was perfect for all baseboards in my home, but what I love most is that it makes it so easy to clean behind tv stands, heavy furniture and headboards of beds without having to struggle to move furniture! Also makes the job a lot quicker",5
Happy with purchase.,5
"Love this mop. No more bending over to clean the baseboards or drag a chair around to clean the top of the doors.Comes with 2 removable cloths which are easy to clean, really good velour stick on, can use the pads either dry or wet. Wipes all the dust off what more could u have on your baseboards! Some of the reviews say won’t scrub clean, it’s a mop of course it won’t, if u have scuff marks or stains then of course it won’t come off with a mop, u need to scrub with a magic eraser and some elbow grease.",5
"I had the traditional (& super expensive & painful) laser hair removal a few years ago at a med spa & due to lack of maintenance the hair came back. But this device is surpassing the results/expectations by a mile already. I’m on treatment 8 or 9 now & barely have any hair growth & I am doing full body pretty much! I am Hispanic & come from a family of very thick, stubborn hair. However, I am pretty pale but still struggle with the dark, thick hair. My skin is so smooth & soft now. The device is lightweight & so easy to use. Pain is minimal, most of the time I don’t even feel anything. It’s quick. It works so well, I bought one for a family member. I did experience a blister on my first use, but haven’t since then & I am using it at the max level. My skin tends to be on the more sensitive side, so I was not worried & it healed just fine. Literally love this thing, it’s the best purchase I’ve ever made & the price is great for what you get in the end! This is a must!",5
"I went to a professional Laser names A&E Laser in CNY. 16 visits - they did not work!I starting using the INNZA Laser Hair Removal October 2024, its now almost Decemeber 1st 2024 AND I HAVE RESULTS!!!! I use this mahine 2x a week everywhere on my body! My work breaks I do smaller areas as my face and stomach. At home on my couch, I laser my legs and other random areas. This is so simple to use and IT WORKS!!!!!! I cant wait for July for our summer months to be HAIR FREE and not embarrest by unwanted facial hair or anywhere else! This INNZA Laser Hair Removal IS GAME CHANGING FOR REMOVING HAIR and making it affordable for anyone who needs it! I swear I would do a commercial for these people, Im so obsessed!",5
"I’m not kidding about this product, this is my genuine and honest review:I’m a Latina, I struggled with dark, thick, wire-like hairs on my face, mostly beard area. I waxed for years and always had ingrown hairs and constantly had to pluck missed hairs that the wax didn’t get. The ingrown hairs were so bad and painful and would often leave scars from when I’d dig out the hairs to pluck. I’d have to wax at least every week because these hairs insisted on growing back quickly. I’d go to work with irritated skin from the wax and it sucked because coworkers would tell me why my skin was red and irritated, I was always embarrassed having to explain it’s from waxing at home. I was super self conscious about the heavy hair growth on my face, sideburns, chin, and mustache area. After 4-5 years, I finally gave up on the wax and looked into laser hair removal. I got some price quotes to get lasered professionally but it was always out of my budget. Then I did some more research on at home laser devices and stumbled on this one. They had a great deal at the time and I got it for 70% off which sold me right away. I read it takes time to actually see some progress so I was patient and used it consistently about once or twice a week followed by putting aloe Vera on my skin after use. I did this for about 3 months and I’m extremely happy to say these hairs hardly grow back!! And when some hairs do grow back, they are thin, almost clear looking hairs that feel like nothing when plucked. I can go months now not even using the laser and the hairs hardly grow back. This product really did make me feel so much better about myself and got rid of my self consciousness of having heavy female facial hair. So if you’re still iffy about purchasing, please just do it already. I swear on anything this product really works. I’m extremely happy I no longer deal with having a beard anymore lol",5
"I have PCOS and am biracial, which makes for a TERRIBLE combo when it comes to managing facial hair. I have had a hairy chin since I was a teenager that was manageable with tweezing or shaving, but as I got older my hair turned into a big thick, coarse, beard any man could be proud of. Me as a woman? Not so much. Soon, there were too many hairs to tweeze, waxing never got all of the hair, and it was impossible to get a good angle on it, hair removal creams were too weak for the hair but any stronger and they would have been to strong for my face, plus if I had a pimple or razor burn I couldn’t use them, and when I went in for laser hair removal they told me my skin was too dark for treatment.Years of shaving against the grain, (because with the grain never got a smooth enough shave) have caused significant discoloration on my chin and made it darker. I wouldn’t care about that since I can cover the color with concealer, but of course, even after shaving EVERY MORNING my hair would grow back by 4pm and leave me with 5 o clock shadow. To understand how well this product works, I need you to understand, these were THICK, BLACK, LONG hairs that grow straight out in a matter of hours. They are the most coarse hairs I have on my body, even including more personal areas, they are that wiry. Literally feels like a bottle brush coming out of my chin!On my wedding day I was worried I would have to hide a razor on me, sneak into the bathroom, shave, and reapply my chin makeup, it was SO bad. After two weeks of using this product at level 5 on my face, 3-4 times a week, I have been able to shave in the morning before treatment and not had to shave again until the next afternoon. TWO WEEKS and an issue I’ve dealt with for 15 years is improved. Even just having to shave only once a day instead of morning and night is a Godsend, but the idea that I could possibly one day have to shave less than that is incredible. I attached a picture so you could see what shade I am, and what shade my discolored chin is. The fact that the laser can tell the difference between my hair and my hyper-pigmented skin is incredible to me considering professionals turned me away when my chin wasn’t as dark. I took a chance on this device because it looked like my skin shade on my face was the absolute darkest it’s approved to be used on or a little darker.I have had laser treatments on a tattoo in the past and the person performing the treatments warned me on brown skin, discoloration can occur making your skin lighter or darker. For me it was worth the risk because I already had such significant discoloration, and it bothered me way less than the hair, which just made me feel like less of a woman. I have not noticed any color change one way or another from this laser, but I am taking pictures to see if there is a change and I will update this review if I notice anything since I know that is important to others.Bottom line: This device is easy to use, especially for small areas. I’m sure it will work on large areas as well, but it will certainly take some time. I originally was displeased with the tiny window because I think it will take my legs a looooong time to get done, but the window is exactly the right size for my upper lip and chin, so I think any bigger would not work. I don’t think the pain is too bad at power level 5, but I have not gone past this due to my skin tone. The fact that I have to shave HALF to a THIRD as often after only 6 uses is just insane.I say if you’re thinking about it, just do it! Especially if you’re just on the border of the “recommended skin tones” on the chart. I love, love, love this device and want to try it on my husband’s back hair soon! One million stars if I could. Thank you thank you thank you for helping me feel more like a woman again.",5
This is a life saver,5
Love it,5
"I absolutely love this facial peel-off mask! It’s been a game-changer for my skincare routine. From the moment I applied it, the cooling sensation was incredibly refreshing and soothing. It dried quickly, making it so easy to use, and peeling it off was both satisfying and effective.My skin felt instantly smoother and looked so much brighter after the first use. It does an amazing job of removing oil and impurities, leaving my pores deeply cleansed and noticeably minimized. I’ve also seen a huge improvement in my skin tone—thanks to the niacinamide, my complexion is more even and radiant.This mask truly delivers everything it promises, and I can’t recommend it enough. If you’re looking for clearer, healthier, and glowing skin, this is the one to try!",5
"I just got this and really like this brand now. I bought another one right away. Super easy to use, smells really good and feels really good- simple, like not a lot of chemicals. Peels off really easy too. Other peel off ones are pretty messy. Eager to try some of their other stuff.",5
"I really like this mask, propolis heals the skin well, removes rashes. It dries quickly and after removing the film, the skin is perfectly moisturized and shiny.",5
I use this facial mask once a week and it’s easy to apply to my faceIt leaves my skin soft and not dry .The scent was pleasantI love this product,5
"This mask has it ALL!!! Not only does it balance out your skin tone, moisturize and nourish the skin, minimize pores and wrinkles, brightens the skin, BUT IT ALSO CLEARS OUT BLACK-/WHITEHEADS???? it's literally all my skin products and masks put into one bottle T-T <3 It's a dream come true; a face mask that is truly a one-hit wonder <3 <3 <3 <3Although it might be worth mentioning that this stuff as a detoxifier is hardcore; the first day after using it, my face started to break out a bit, but only because it *continues* to bring out the toxins in your face. By day 2, my face was clearing up and looking pretty. And by day 3??? i literally looked 2yrs younger (i even got some compliments)!! As i've continued using the face mask over the past month or so since purchasing it, this remains consistent; your face looks better and better as the days pass, resulting to the skin becoming smooth and glossy like a k-pop star (just like the advertisement said it would) after a couple days!!Also worth mentioning that the mask is sticky and thick. Like with most masks, i used my face mask applicator tool thingy, but found that to be rather frustrating with this stuff :/ So now i instead simply wash my hands first, then apply the mask with my fingers; makes it a lot easier. Also, i found that even if i think i applied it on a bit too thick, it still dries the same so that's cool ^-^You should definitely buy this! You won't regret it!",5
"This smelled a little chemical-ly, but it’s only on your face for like, 25 mins so it’s tolerable. Satisfying and easy to peel off. and it worked immediately because it shrunk my forever chronic chin pimple. Gonna keep using this.",5
It was damaged but returned thbks,5
I feel it does work. My face feels softer and fresher. And it’s so satisfying peeling the mask off that I always look forward to using this mask.,5
"It’s a great solution for 1st world problems lolWe got a new bed and we couldn’t change the position of the tv, and the angle was causing neck pain and discomfort. I initially thought the glasses were gimmicky and wouldn’t work that well, but I was proven wrong! I can watch tv or read a book in bed without straining my neck! I’ve noticed my posture feels better b/c I’m no longer hunched over or in a weird position. Wearing them feels like I’m using a VR headset.Cons: my eyes do feel tired more quickly, so I’m unsure if I will get used to it or will atop using them b/c of this. They are also slightly too heavy, and are a little uncomfortable on my nose. They have left marks on my nose when I wear them for a little while.",5
"I have not tested it for a long time but you may initially feel a bit uncomfortable due to the middle of the glasses having a barrier between your eyes, so whatever you are looking at you will feel like each of your eyes are looking through binoculars with a division in between. You will however have ""no blind spot"" in the middle and your mind will stitch both images together giving you a full picture.The discomfort: Imagine if you had your hand in a karate chop position, now put that in between your two eyes. You will still see everything in front of you and the hand itself will not cause a blind spot but you will feel discomfort by the fact that the hand is in the middle of the two images. I do not know if will cause eye strain for other people but it caused me a little bit, perhaps it just takes some getting used to so I will not knock the product down much for it.For the manufacturer, it would be interesting if you guys produce a version where the eyes are not separated so the middle barrier/division is not present. (basically like a jordie laforge style)great concept, very good execution. perhaps version 2 will be perfect?",5
"I absolutely love these 90 ° Degree Lazy Reading Glasses! For medical reasons, I lay down multiple times through the day and these 90 ° degree glasses save my arms and neck from strain while using my iPhone and iPad. They fit perfectly over my glasses and make them convenient and easy to use. These 90 ° degree glasses can be a bit heavy but with a bit of adjustment I am able to mitigate any uncomfortable pressure. These 90 ° degree glasses are also GREAT for watching TV or just looking out the window ( of a SHIP ! ) while laying in bed without additional pillows or neck strain.",5
"These glasses are great. I got them for myself and 3 other roommates. My only complaints are that they are a little heavy, and the screen size seems shrunken down compared to my regular eyesight. but it's not noticeable after a few minutes. Unless you look away from what you're looking at.",5
"They actually look really nice and not cheap looking. I loved them so much, that I gave my best friend a pair, and she loves them.",5
"I have to have reading glasses and these work for me and my husband! We need different strengths, but these readers work on both of us!",5
These are great handy reading glasses to have nearby.,5
Based on price point I was surpised at quility and looks of these. Even received compliments on how they look on me. Happy camper here.,5
We keep several pairs around the house. My wife and I have different prescriptions for reading and closeup work but with these glasses we can use the same pair of glasses and can see equally well. Seems like pure magic to me. And they are inexpensive.,5
My husband needed new cheater readers since he lost his last pair. Bought him this 3 set and he is very happy with them. He can see great and looks nice in them. He said they feel cheaply made. I told him the price and he said yep just keep these in your cart so you can reorder when need be. He is very with them.,5
These do not hurt my eyes and feel nice on my face.,5
Love these reading glasses. Have them stationed in 3 different rooms to quick access.,5
"This 3 pack is great, for the money.Anyone that wears readers knows that you’re constantly losing them.I didn’t, but some people say they’re hard to get use too, which is to me normal just like any new glasses.",5
My girlfriend loves them,5
You get your bang for your buck with this deal they work great,5
"Like that I can have a pair in my car, home computer desk & at the office.",5
They worked great and can take a beating. Nothing that’s alike here.,5
I like the product great price for 3 was great deal I like it the come with cover,5
My husband must have these and they shipped fast,5
I was getting a crook in my neck when laying out by the pool for too long reading. These are fun and work well. I wish there was a way to use these with glasses on.,5
My husband loved it ! He doesn’t have neck problem watching tv anymore 😆,5
"I have fibromyalgia with near-constant back and neck pain, so I frequently lay down while working on my laptop at home. These have been such a *huge* help! Typing is tricky since the glasses kind of throw off my equilibrium a bit, but it’s still possible, and as long as what I’m doing is mostly reading and using the mouse, they’re wonderful. My husband tried to play Call of Duty with them out of curiosity, and the only problem was the equilibrium issue; he could see the TV just fine from the couch, he just couldn’t get the hang of playing in that position. In other words, looking through them is nearly identical to how you would normally see, just slightly smaller. The only “con” to these, if it’s bad enough to even be considered a con, is that the upper part of the glasses rests snugly across the forehead, so they leave a pretty deep indentation on my forehead after I take them off (not at all painful), and when I get too warm they can fog up. But that’s the only “issue” I can come up with. They’re really great!",5
Was quite skeptical...I needed something for bed room tv as it sits at the front of my bed on a dresser. I would get neck strains and arm pains. would move around alot to get a good view of the tv.Until now...I lay flat on my back with a perfect view with these glasses. Nice and sturdy ...well built...awesome fit with regular seeing glasses.I'm very happy I bought these..I actually fell asleep faster and with them on hahaha. That's how comfortable they are.,5
This is a bit heavy on the bridge of the nose. I expected that based on the reviews. I went ahead and purchased and am so glad I did. I have severe endometriosis bd get intense abdominal pain. It is great to enjoy laying down and putting zero pressure on the abdomen yet being able to watch programs and read. Highly recommend and wish I had it back after I had surgery,5
"brilliant, just what i needed",5
Purchased these for my husband and he loves them! He loves the fit and the quality for the price.,5
"I assumed that these were a joke when I first saw them. When I received them I realized that the joke was on me... because they actually work.These are a comfortable set of glasses with blacked out lenses. Mounted to the center of each is a large glass (I assume it's glass... they're heavy) prism. It's the prism, and the way it's been cut that allows you to see horizontally.Don't misunderstand... these will never be mistaken for some sort of ""spy"" eyewear. They're way too obvious. In fact, if people see you wearing these they'll immediately assume you're suffering from some dire handicap, and and are likely to offer to buy you a meal.I can wear these and look straight ahead, and still read what is in front of me on the table, in in my hands. These eliminate the need to crane your neck forward.I tried laying on the bed and on the couch, and reading with the book centered on my chest. Perfect!I even laid flat on the floor and read, with nothing propping up my head. Amazing.It's obvious to me that these would be perfect if you were to go to the beach (hopefully, a deserted beach) and laid flat on your towel, reading. In the case where you're on a normal beach with people around, expect lots of stares and giggling.Additionally, I can wear my reading glasses under these. It's still comfortable.So, any negatives? Yes, there is one. Because the prisms are glass and heavy, they make the glasses front-heavy. So if you're say, sitting at the table with them on, reading straight down, they are trying to pull away from your face. It's likely that's why they seem to imply that they're designed for laying down to read, for which they are, excellent.I really like these, but trust me, I won't be wearing them in the bleachers at the next Astros game.Very clever idea that actually works very well.",5
"You’ll look crazy, but you’ll also be comfy, so it’s a win.",5
"I loved the original version but these are even better. The view is clear and does not make objects appear smaller and further away. I prefer the way these prism lens are sturdier and solid, have no framing issues, are easier to clean, and do not stick out as much which allow them to fit in a sunglass case. I use them every night when I lay down to read my kindle before bed and the comfy weight on my face also helps me fall asleep, as the original did. I have also used them to watch TV from bed and also while leaning back in my desk chair. I have gotten so used to wearing them that I very much dislike the eye muscle strain I feel when reading or watching something and I have to tilt my head or eyes.Edit: I use both the older version and this one depending on my mood for Kindle or phone light glare. This version of lazy glasses allows the light from your phone to be visible below the lens so if you are unfocused you may get distracted by the light visible below the lens. The original version with the black frames blocks this light so you only see through the lenses. I keep them both on my bedside table.",5
"A must for ""tech neck,"" sitting with your neck craned while using your phone or reading a book is terrible for your posture and causes your neck to move forward over time exacerbating the issue until your neck and shoulder muscles are in constantly pain. I've used a denneroll that was prescribed by my chiropractor in the past and while it helps, it forces to to stare at the ceiling for extended periods or hold a book/device directly over your face to keep you occupied (I don't know if any of you have dropped a phone on your face while doing this but it's not fun).With this I can use the denne roll and watch something that's playing on a TV or resting on my chest. Even better I've found these glasses can replace the use of a denne roll and I can instead stare at the ceiling while watching TV or other tasks from the couch and have my neck in the relaxed position.In addition it allows me to multitask throughout the day by having a book resting in my lap while at my computer, I can look through the lenses to read or write what's in my lap and then look over the top of my glasses like you would bifocals and be able to read and use my computer screens.Now, I would caution walking around the house with them on (I have on occasion but it takes some getting used to walking while staring at your feet and tilting your head from side to side while doing this can be very disorienting.I like this design over others that I have tried specifically because you can see over the top of the glasses by having them rest a little lower on your nose. The picture is still clear and it's easy to use. Very much recommend for those suffering from a pain in the neck or stiff trapezius muscles relating to posture.",5
Perfect!,5
"I make jewelry and do a lot of looking down when I am stringing beads. I saw glasses like these in a video from another crafter and decided to try them. I am so glad I did! They are a little weird to get used to at first, but I used them for a couple hours this evening and my neck is not hurting like it normally is. I've seen concerns of some brands seeming very heavy because of the prisms, but these do not seem to be overly heavy. Very pleased!",5
Had spine surgery and had to lay down keeping neck straight. These allowed me to watch television to pass the time. Worked incredibly well. Well built and functioned as advertised.,5
"These are the best reading glasses I have ever owned. Clear and comfortable. I now own 3 pairs of them so I can keep 1 pair in my car, 1 pair upstairs, and 1 pair downstairs. Highly recommended!",5
Just the best. Apart from the case which is clearly designed by Porsche interns.,5
I had older pair that were +1.75 from 8+ years ago and they have never fallen out of my flat lens sunglasses. Eyes changed and purchased the +2.50. These stick on bifocals work on lenses with minimal curvature and great on flat lenses. Very clear on my flat lens sunglasses. I tried them on my wrap around sunglasses with a noticeable curve and they do not work/stick. So keep that in mind.That's probably why when I purchased 8+ years ago from Grainger they were listed with the safety goggles which have flat lens. Now you can find bifocal safety glasses that look like wrap arounds instead of the goggle type but hey are not bifocals and usually used for workplace.,5
"After cataract surgery I needed sunglasses with readers. Already had three pair of plain Maui Jim sunglasses and wasn’t looking forward to buying all new Maui Jim’s w’readers. Found these lenses by accident and thought for this price I’d try them. They install easily and the vision is better than expected. Main concern was they were a bit large, but the directions said they could be trimmed. Positioned the lenses where I wanted them, used an ultra fine point sharpie to mark the area sticking out below the lens and then slowly trimmed them with sharp small scissors. Worked like a charm and didn’t hamper the vision a bit. Like the idea of being able to switch lens power for reading, driving, etc. In a perfect world they could be a bit thinner, but that’s not as much of an issue after they’re cut down. Hope they sell a lot of these for a long time so they’ll be available down the road if needed.",5
"I wasn't super optimistic given the many mixed reviews I've seen about whether these actually stick to your mask and make it through multiple mask defogging rinses.I followed the best directions I found on the web (not the packaging) to a tee - wash out the mask carefully with toothpaste/brush, rinse mask well & dry completely, soak the stick-on lenses in warm water, apply them to the inside bottom corners with the convex side pointing up/away from the mask lens (concave side down), press firmly in place and blot off any residual moisture, press firmly again, let dry overnight.I followed this procedure the day before I went diving in Thailand last December, and they stayed on just fine through defogging and mask clearing. Two dives that day, then three dives a few days later and they were still going strong. Worked perfectly! Could see my computer/guages and camera settings clearly, and marine life in the distance perfectly. Can see how it would be great for snorkeling masks as well. Made my diving experience perfect!",5
They were easy to apply and they stayed in position. I even cut some down across the top as they were a hair too big for some glasses. I have used these for years and you can reapply them in other glasses. They absolutely work as bifocals.,5
"These are GREAT, you can lay down in bed & still watch tv or use ur phone. For someone who is bed ridden or just lazy lol, this is Great & a Fun Gift as well.",5
They work! Bought for after surgery where I had to lay on my back. They are heavy so wore for shorter periods.,5
"I bought these for my aunt following her spinal surgery and she said, ‘This is the best s*** you have ever gotten me.’ She can watch tv comfortably while lying flat and she is SO MUCH more comfortable. Totally worth it.",5
"I saw Mark from Ladbaby using these to keep an eye on his kids while he's laying down and I had to try them. I like using them for watching tv while I'm laying in bed. It works perfectly. I don't need to be propped up on a pillow to see the tv. I can lay on my back like normal, in a totally relaxed position and watch tv at the same time. The glasses are sturdy. They don't feel cheap at all. They have some weight to them. They work great! I was not disappointed with my purchase.",5
I wanted these glasses for TV and phone viewing. TV viewing with glasses is great. Phone viewings isn't too great. Maybe it is a matter if adjusting to wearing more often. They are heavy but comfortable. I selected these because I can wear them over my prescription glasses.,5
Quality materials.,5
Perfect reading area and very light weight and comfortable to wear.,5
"Love these, lite weight and they really cut the glare.",5
These are very light weight and I love the clear distinction between the bifocal and the normal lense.,5
I use these for my hobbies. Easy to clip onto my glasses and take off.,5
"My regular eyeglasses are rather old, and the bi-focal part is out of date (no longer strong enough). I create hand-made greeting cards and I need to see small items clearly, so I ordered these clip-ons to use when I need strong close up vision. These work perfectly, plus they are sturdy and very well made. I'm so happy with this purchase and the seller, that I'm going to order another pair in a slightly different magnification. I love Amazon and I'm very impressed with the sellers they let sell on their site.",5
In the past I resorted to wearing two pairs of glasses when working on my computer. I wore my regular glasses and then a pair of reading glasses on top of those. Very uncomfortable and didn't work very well. These computer glasses are just perfect. They flip up out of the way easily when needed and I can now sit at a comfortable distance from the screen and still read with ease. I would highly recommend these glasses to computer users with bad vision.,5
I bought this for my husband because his regular glasses are not strong enough. They are easy to install and seem to work well.,5
Suits my purpose very well.,5
"At 80 years old I was diagnosed with macular degeneration but since I like to read and do artwork, I have been using these clip-on glasses for many years. W/o them I cannot see. I have several pairs to keep where I need them and they work great. I am happy with this purchase.",5
"I wasn't sure about ordering these to use on my very expensive glasses. I was afraid that I might scratch my lenses but they absolutely do not! There is a spring clip that you press open and position theses glasses over your regular lenses. All the parts that touch your lenses are covered in plastic or rubber. They stay in place and don't slip around. It is very easy to flip the lenses up when you don't need them. I am using them to read music on a music stand. My regular glasses are progressive bi-focals but the bi-focal is positioned at the bottom of the lenses and I can't use them unless it point my nose up to the ceiling. These clip-ons provide the additional magnification just where I need it. I have also used them for doing detailed craft, sewing and bead work.",5
"I find these days the glasses they make (progressive type) are great for distance, but your reading area is not magnified like with the older bifocals and the reading spot can be so small you have to move your head back and forth because you can't move your eyes.These clip on glasses fix all that! They offered me magnification I needed and a larger reading area when worn over my glasses. You need to buy the right number for you. Ask your doctor. 2.00 was what my doc said I needed over my glasses and it works perfectly. (You could probably also go to a store that sells reading glasses in the pharmacy area and try some on over your glasses to figure out what lets you read.)",5
"These clipon readers are perfect! The lens are excellent quality, just like prescription eyeglasses. The clips have rubber covers which prevent scratching your eyeglasses. The clip is strong and keeps the readers firmly in place even if you are moving around. The readers flip up when you don’t need them and still stay firmly attached and the clipping mechanism is small and doesn’t impede your line of sight. The readers come with a soft, good quality case. These are the best quality clipon readers I have ever used. They fit over my very thick prescription lenses.",5
"I absolutely adore the auto-focus feature of these eyeglasses. It's truly remarkable how they effortlessly adapt to my surroundings, allowing me to move freely without the need to constantly remove them and experience dizziness. The fact that these glasses adjust according to my eyesight is simply mind-blowing. I'm pleasantly surprised by how they can accommodate both my husband and me, despite our different prescription strengths. It's incredibly convenient and promotes sharing. Moreover, the design, with its sleek and round style, not only caters to my visual needs but also exudes a sense of versatility that suits both genders. These glasses truly encompass everything I desire in eyewear.",5
Can see thing close up and futher away .,5
Very good quality. The write up didn’t specify that all the glasses are not sunglasses. The picture shows one pair with two regular and that is what you get. It was confusing. But I like them. Just know that only one pair of sun glasses is included.,5
"A single pair of glasses is great. I’d need two different pairs because my eyes have different needs. With these, I can see great without needing an optometrist!",5
I love love these reading glasses. They adjust to your vision they are comfortable and the best part I live are the shades. Now I don't have to keep changing my glasses from shades to reading glasses when I go out.,5
Love the self adjusting glasses,5
"Middle of cataract change, so need something until eyes settle in. These worked like a personal made lens ! So sharp and clear. One eye so far, will add update after next eye. Tried the adjustable horror ones out, total waste of money on them. These are Great ! Believe I need middle end of strength? Even for a few weeks they will be worth the money at least. Did not want to keep buying reading glasses, as the eyes settle out on focal point for final need. Update; found the individual lense rate reading glasses a bit more comfortable, more viewing width. Issue is knowing what u needed to order. .75 good to me.",5
They fit well and they are amazing in their ability to give me the sight I need. I have one eye that has been done for long distance and the other for reading. These help with the reading. They fit and seem sturdy. Loved getting three pairs at once so I have leave them ind different places.,5
"Man... even my prescription reading glasses suck. This is the bomb! It actually makes it CLEAR with no aberrations. I have a bad eye due to some surgery and it refracted all over the place, and regular reading glasses barely help focus it back, but this thing totally does it :) AND, it is SHARPER with full power focus and clarity than anything I've ever put on my eyes. Amazing! Takes a bit of getting used to, but it somehow works for my close and intermediate distances (I've had cornea thinned out due to a ton of Lasik, PRK, etc.) and thus sometimes even need reading glasses to see in the distance, strangely enough. The bridge of the nose fits perfectly, too, it doesn't need those weird nose bridge devices. And it doesn't stain the glasses (especially the upper) like regular glass-made prescriptions or off-the-shelf readers. Simply amazing!",5
"They actually do work. 3 pair for $10, wow. I keep one pair next to my computer and another on the kitchen counter where I read my mail. I would use my prescription glasses if reading a long text or a book, but for the convenience of a pair here and there for simple tasks, these are perfect. I gave the third pair to a friend who had stopped by and I asked her to read a short piece. I said 'try these'. She was impressed.By the way they are very comfortable and are quite sturdy.",5
"These glasses are closer to pair of magnifying glasses than everyday glasses (or they are for me... I don't wear glasses). If working on very small things (modeling, electronics, etc.) they are excellent, well priced, and come in multiple pairs. Brilliant product.",5
"These light specs are awesome, been using them for over 10yrs. they serve my purpose.",5
I bought these for my husband. The price from Amazon was the best. They are so high at Walgreens. My husband love them! He uses them while working on machines for his job!,5
Husband loves these glasses and uses them all the time. Especially good in low light. Shipper sent the wrong strength the first time but corrected it and shipped the right pair immediately--5 star customer service!,5
Needed these for lighting and vision,5
"Fast shipping. Product works as described, very satisfied. My previous more expensive glasses which were a As Seen ON TV item had two bright LEDS as this one does, however, worked on one switch so when the battery died you had to wait for the charge to complete before using it again, this new one has 2 switches so when working with one light and the battery drains you can simply switch on the other light to complete the task, besides that the more expensive unit failed within a week, garbage, and not only did the battery fail the left support broke and now just dangles on the wire. Very satisfied with the new pair, feels durable.",5
I really liked how the glasses put out a lot of light to cover the reading area.,5
"Great item; thus far, I like it.",5
Had cataract surgery and only needed glasses for computer. Works better than prescription glasses I had before. I have three pairs.,5
I'd watch your local drug store for buy one get one or buy one get one for half. Other than that the price is pretty much the same as my drug store. They look good on and come in a few colors. They put up with a bit of abuse but like most readers they lenses are prone to popping out and once they do you need new ones.,5
"I have the standard frame type for years, needed a new pair. So when I saw the Ironman version, I jumped at it. Glad I didLightweight, pliable, flexible and perfect viewing range.",5
"These are the second pair my husband has ordered, due to the size (for wider) faces, and the lightweight nature of the material. Stays in place very well, and a modern design make them a perfect option for reading glasses!",5
"Because my lenses include correction for slight misalignment (cockeye), to read music scores on a stand I need low-power readers large enough to wear over my prescription glasses. These work perfectly for that purpose.",5
"Got some prescription readers -- very expensive. They work only in a band just in front of your eyes, which means your head has to be in a certain relationship to the material. This is a problem -- I often lay down in bed with my computer on my chest, which made it hard to get to the proper angle. These glasses look good and can be used at any angle. Much better for me. The only downside is that if you want to shift your gaze to distance you have to take them off, can't simply look over the prescription area.",5
I've been wearing them since receipt of same. The nose pads are screw attached and can be changed to softer feel nose pads. Not brass therefore no green corrosion to be removed.,5
Very nice for working at the computer.,5
Very light on the face and nose bridge! I had the gold before. I bought the gun metal this time .I get compliments on the glasses!,5
"I like them. They work good as cheaters, and they look nice.",5
